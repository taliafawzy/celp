Went in to see the owner of the salon for some blonde bayalage and to cut off the ends of my hair. Came out with brassy hair and my very, long hair was just pass my shoulders. The color I was left with was this brown color with brassy highlights concentrated at the bottom. I called and the owner agreed to have me come back to fix the color and get what I originally wanted free of charge. In my second appointment, he basically spread that brassy, orange color all over my hair. It was horrifying. I had to go spend more money in another salon to try to fix the color I had. The new hairdresser couldn't believe I had paid for such a color. Very disappointed and heartbroken.", "date": "2017-01-15 04:59:00"}

I read your YELP review and headed on over to check it out while I am still in Ajax.  Canbe Food is packed with a steady flow of customers coming and going and why?....cause the food is excellent.  It was only 5:15pm on a Monday and super busy ... excellent selection of food items (overwhelming when you are not too sure what you are in the mood for).  We got the Chili Chicken, Chicken Curry and Chicken Biryani combo - generous portions, excellent spice rating (real deal spice) - busy place, staff super helpful and friendly and go out of their way to describe the individual dishes.  2 Huge servings for $18.08 of combo for 2 people.\n\nBig thanks to the guy from Oshawa in the line-up next to us who was super helpful in what to order (now I understand why he drove all the way from Oshawa for this grub....its very good). Another plus for Ajax having this place ( I am only the second person to review considering this place is the busiest place in the new mall I expect more reviews with good writeup's forthcoming from others)....  absolutely a must try (Ajax just keeps getting better and better \"food-wise\").  The food is in those buffet style hotplate's that keep food \"warm\"; so isn't scalding hot by any means - but still tasty none the less.  Most customers were take-out  (there is a seating area with a few people sitting down having food).  There are frozen paratha's and frozen food items in the freezer section (that they have made).\n\nBig plus having so many ethnic places in Ajax that have good food, decent portions, good prices and excellent quality of ingredients.  I noticed reviewers for their other location saying parking is sparse at their other location - note: their Ajax location has plenty of parking btw.", "date": "2016-04-11 21:38:33"}

We came as a group of 5 on a Saturday night and had a fantastic time. \n\nIf you are coming on Saturday, make sure you don't come before 9:30 and plan to spend the WHOLE night here.  For Saturday nights, it is a set menu (we paid $45 per person plus alcohol) and you get loads of excellent food and entertainment.\n\nAround 10:00pm, they brought out a bunch of appetizers (excellent baba ghanoush, hummus, lebneh with mint, Shanklish (which is a middle eastern blue cheese type of cheese ball), tabouleh, Kibbeh nayyeh (which is raw meet so I was pretty skeptical about but was delicious) and lots of pita.  You can keep asking for more of any of these items.\n\nAround 11:00pm a singer came out.  Although I couldn't understand what she was singing, she sounded good to me and people got up to dance which was fun.\n\nAround midnight, they brought out the meat (chicken and beef kabobs and kafta).  By this time of course, you are STUFFED but I had a bit of everything and it was all pretty tasty.  I don't think you can ask for more meat but truthfully, I don't know how anyone could anyway.\n\nThen, a belly dancer came out and I think she gave about a 30 minute show and it was really good.\n\nAfter that they bring out Turkish coffee and some sort of cheese dessert.  Then the singer came on again and sang until closing.\n\nWe stayed until 3:00am.  I would definitely recommend going to this place!  I'm not from a Middle Eastern background and it was a really great way to experience their food and culture.  I was with people who are originally from the Middle East and they all loved it and said it reminded them of home which I think is a pretty good recommendation!", "date": "2015-08-07 17:25:22"}

I don't think the food was worth coming back to deal with the poor service and knowing that I have had better elsewhere I can say I won't miss this place or remember it.", "date": "2015-05-30 02:45:14"}

For pho its pho tien thanh;  for rice dishes its pho linh. \n\nThis place has both good pho and rice dishes!  Moving to Ajax comes with its ups and downs. But this place is the hidden gem in ajax - where the restaurant scene is crowded by south asian, Caribbean and Afghanistan oriented cuisine.\n\nWe love it here and its our only choice for vietnamese food even though we live next door to pho metro (crap).", "date": "2016-07-08 18:49:04"}

Excellent experience.  If this review was based solely on our experience with Jim, it would be 5 stars.\n\nHowever, I am reviewing their service department, as we, wanting to be loyal to the dealership we had a great sales experience with, decided to bring our vehicle in for the regular maintenance it requires.  Despite living in Markham right near Markham, Acura and working Downtown, close to Downtown, Acura we chose to make the drive out to Acura East.\n\nFrom the first service we should have known not to return.  The useless \"service advisor\" did not have our appointment noted despite us calling to confirm it with her the day before.  We had asked for the day use of vehicle, which we were told we would get - she again said that this is not possible and she had no record of the request.  An hour later, given a rental from Enterprise, we were on our way, with a promise from her the 'service advisor' to call us upon the car being ready.  It was estimated to be a two hour job.  We call after about 3 hours.  No answer.  Finally we get through 4 hours later and she says 'ooops, my bad, your car has been ready since two hours ago...I forgot to call you\".  \n\nWhat?? How can this even happen?  She was very casual about it and shrugged it off when we arrived there.  We had asked for an accessory to be fixed onto the interior of the trunk, this wasn't done.  She hadn't even communicated this to the mechanic, despite us asking the shop rate for them to affix it and telling them to add that to our total.\n\nTHEN...one day after this service, we notice the same issue wrong with the car.  We go back and have much the same run-around.  All errors point to the doorknob Amina working the front desk.  She \"advises\" people incorrectly, telling all customers to 'save their money' and not get this or that repair done now, but to come in later for it despite us repeatedly telling her its not about saving money for us, but for our car to be maintained.  A dealership turning away service???  I know, hard to believe, but go to Acura East and talk to Amina and you will find she is SO knowledgeable about everything and can just advise you about your vehicle without once looking under the hood.\n\nThe service manager is apparently the 3rd one in 6 months and after speaking with him I can foresee a fourth one coming soon.  Passing the buck, making excuses and shoddy service.  \n\nSO..  Go to Acura East for car repairs if:\n\nA) you have heaps of time to waste making 3+ visits for one service repair to be done correctly\n\nB) you love showing up for CONFIRMED and VERIFIED appointments that you have taken a day off of work for that the person at the front desk has no record of ( despite the followup appt being made IN PERSON and TO HER...Amina this is once again the typically shoddy work of you)\n\nC) You hate or are 'over' your car as after an experience with these people you'd feel you're better off ramming right off a cliff.", "date": "2015-10-02 19:14:53"}

It seems the big window with all the dogs getting groomed is only if you are getting your dog trimmed/shaved. When we dropped him off, we were told that the puppy bath would take about an hour. We were fine with that (actually, we were expecting that), because the puppy bath experience offers a bath & blow dry, 15-minute brushing, nail trim, ear cleaning/hair removal/flushing, scissor feet/pad shaving, sanitary trim, and anal glands cleaning. After an hour of browsing through the store waiting for our pup, we decided to just wait in the waiting area of the grooming corner of the store. No grooming staff was to be found at the front desk for 15 minutes. Another gentleman who was picking up his dog had to talk to 3 associates of the store before they got one of the grooming staff to the front desk to finally pick up his dog. It was then we were told that Echko would be another 30-45 minutes because his groomer, Brooke, went on break and \"he just needs to be dried still\". My boyfriend and I were pretty confused because all we could imagine was our just-bathed puppy, still wet, waiting for this unprofessional groomer to go on break. That isn't the worst part, though. \n\nSo we continue to wait in the waiting area, see her come back from her break, and hope since he just needs to be dried, it won't be much longer. Turns out we ended up waiting a maximum of an hour from when the staff member at the front desk informed us the groomer went on break mid-bath session. While we waited, we could hear Echko screaming from the back. We originally thought it was just him howling at other dogs and playing, but now we're not so sure because what is to follow. When we FINALLY got to see him, the groomer made us pay for the bath before letting us inspect him. Luckily for us, we didn't pay a dime and had a coupon. When we finally got him, he had tear stains under his eyes on the fur of his face, he ran right to us, and then towards the big window, thinking it was outside. It was as if he just wanted to leave immediately. The groomer said nothing else other than \"he was a good boy, very sweet. I hope you like it!\"\n\nIt wasn't until we got to the car when we had the opportunity to inspect him thoroughly. It turns out, the groomer failed to notify us that she cut his nails too short, cutting the quick, causing many of them to bleed. The fur around his paws were covered in blood and the nails that were quicked were red, bloody, and scabby. I understand accidents happen sometimes, especially with dark coloured nails, but all of the nails that she quicked were clear. She also didn't touch the back nails at all and only cut the front nails, for some reason, even though there were many long nails on his back legs. \n\nMy concern is that she pushed us to pay before we could pick him up (even though the gentleman before us was allowed to pick up his dog before paying), she tried to convince us to re-book before giving us the opportunity to inspect him, then failed to take responsibility for her actions by failing to tell us she quicked the nails.\n\nNot impressed at all and would NEVER recommend PetSmart's Grooming Services to any friends or family. Clearly she was unprofessional, undertrained, and more concerned with commission (if they get any) than caring for my dog.", "date": "2017-10-31 00:48:37"}

I'm not sure what she puts in it for sweetener, but this is absolutely the most delicious lemon soda I've had. I let her know how much I loved it and she proudly let me know that it's a customer favourite. :) Don't forget to try it out if you get a chance to swing by. \n\nThis place is rather small, seating just a few tables at a time, but service is quick and the over all dining experience is pleasant.

Music began at 10pm and they were just fantastic! They played all night, even while the belly dancer performed - also brilliant and entertaining to watch - she used the whole dance floor so everybody could see. 5*\n\nFor some reason the food is not great, which doesn't match the venue! While the spread was impressive, most of the 12 apps/snacks  and even the mains were under-seasoned or just lacking in flavour - potatoes, cauliflower, tabbouleh, felafel, sausages - meh. I did enjoy the kibbeh (raw seasoned beef), along with the baba ganoush, but would have much preferred 2-4 well made apps. \n\nThe last main dish - chicken & beef kebabs - FINALLY, were tasty and tender. I wish this was served earlier when we were hungry instead of at 12.30am & full-but-not-satisfied! I'm torn between rating a 5* night based on 2-3* food.

In my past visits to Running Free in Markham they always provide a great selection for anything to do with running.\nI was specifically looking for a water belt.  i was looking at a specific style when one of the owners came up and started asking questions about my next run.  Their was two types of water belts and I tried on both at his request. For anyone looking to do long distance runs and require a water belt, the Nathan brand is the one you want for the simple fact it is easier to get the bottles back in the belt after taking a drink.  The other brand would have been a nightmare to get the bottles back in the belt.  For those of you who run can understand when you are huffing and puffing while trying to put your bottle back in a belt, if the bottle doesn't slide in easliy, it can be frustrating and a distraction.\nAlso, Running Free offers a variety of free running clinics throughout the week for many running levels and sometimes are sponsored by running sho brands or other brands wanting to market themselves on a local level.  Last week shoe brand, Mizuno, allowed runners to try their running shoes during the running clinic.  This week, Gu, an energy gel company will be giving a talk and providing free samples.\nRunning Free does an amazing job adding value.", "date": "2010-04-20 23:23:48"}

I was told that they would be able to replicate the cake picture I sent for the bottom tier, and yet they did not even have a yellow icing colour and used a dark orange instead, which was saddening since yellow was a favourite colour of the couple and I wanted to have some in there (it looks yellow due to editing in the picture). Many at the party also pointed out that the top tier was crooked, which was embarassing as I got asked if I made it myself. I'm not sure if the cake turned out this way because it was not a wedding cake and thus didn't have as much time spent on it, but I was sad to receive a cake like this after having paid $160. \n\nFour stars for taste and customer service, 2 off for the messy work.", "date": "2018-07-06 20:22:41"}

They'll tell you the current price then they'll go back for the week to two weeks prior to that and let you know if it was on sale and if you missed it and the offer that price well that's just fantastic but do you not think that maybe you should be doing that for every customer in your store and not just offering a few select people a deal?

This was my first experience going to an event (wedding) at Deer Creek, although I had been through with another bride-to-be checking out the venue a few years ago.\n\nThe banquet hall at Deer Creek can hold probably up to 500 people but for this particular day, there were multiple weddings and I think it was sectioned off into three different rooms. We were ushered into one of the middle spaces (cutting through the reception space - which in my book is a massive NO NO) for the ceremony. I think if it were me, I'd avoid having the ceremony indoors at Deer Creek (at least in the main banquet hall) because the room was super plain and a lot of the gorgeous wood and windows that Deer Creek is known for isn't shown. Another few issues, we saw another bride and groom having photos taken outside behind the altar for the wedding I was at; and someone decided to start playing music during the bride and groom's wedding  vows, which was absolutely terrible. Way to ruin their moment!\n\nWe were ushered back out to the front bar area for cocktail hour. A note here, this particular bar is at the front entrance to the entire building so its likely you'll have other wedding guests from other weddings coming through the main entrance. It's also not as nice or as big of a space as the bar that's at the back of the building (which also has a very large patio). I think I saw three people go by once with appetizers and there wasn't much selection (although this could have been a choice by the bride and groom) and most people left their appetizers uneaten on the tables. If you have a wedding more than 100 people, this cocktail hour space is going to be way too small.\n\nBack into the main reception area, nicely laid out, all of the decor was done nicely except for that ugly back wall that separates the rooms. We had an antipasto platter to start (very good), butternut squash soup (good but most people didn't eat theirs), a salad with pecans and fruit (also good but most people didn't eat it) and steak with potatoes (steak was done medium - yay! - but the potatoes were weeeeeeird. Like they were mashed and then refrigerated and then reheated - yuck). \n\nA few other things I noticed - two weddings going on (at least two) and the bathroom garbages were overflowing by 6:30PM. Staff should be on top of that at a venue as nice as this. Same thing with wiping down the counters in the bathrooms - they were soaking wet by this time as well. The staff didn't put enough chairs out for the wedding; they had all of them nicely covered with white satiny covers and then since they hadn't put enough out, they just brought out the regular chairs and put them at the back with no chair covers. Not nice. Oh and the runner that they had laid out for the bride got ripped, multiple times, by people walking on it before the ceremony. They should have fixed it/replaced it as it was a thin paperish runner that could have been laid out again easily.\n\nAll in, Deer Creek is a decent place for this kind of event but I would probably not choose this venue for my own wedding unless I was going to take over the whole banquet room space. Part of what's gorgeous about this venue is the wall to wall windows in that space and all of the wood and detailing, which got lost when the rooms were sectioned off. Disrupting the vows of the wedding was inexcusable and the venue should have done something about making sure that didn't happen before the ceremony even started. The food was good, probably very good as far as wedding food goes, but the whole venue just left me a little unimpressed. \n\nThe wedding itself? Amazing. The venue? Not so much.", "date": "2012-09-10 18:34:34"}

You end up eating less but leave feeling more satisfied.

My favourite was the salted cod dish, YUmmmy. Truly! \n\nThe only bad thing is that I don't live anywhere near this store. I am still thinking about this food days after. The food was not spicy but not bland. Yes, I don't eat much Portuguese food...I want to, now!!!

I've been to 3 other bridal shops in the area and this one was by far the worst in terms of selection and service. The consultant was nice enough at the start. She asked questions, suggested dresses and accessories, but her service level dropped drastically when she realized I wasn't finding what I wanted. The recently remodeled shop is pretty, but the walls don't go all the way to the ceiling and it's very noisy and difficult to hear the other people in your party. Also because of the walls, I could hear my consultant and another employee gossiping about me in the back. My consultant was listing off all the things I wanted in a dress (I assume justifying why she wasn't making a sale) and the other employee replied \"And her budget is only $XXXX!?\" For the record, my budget is healthy according to the research I've done, especially since I am looking for something simple. I haven't experienced a problem at any other store or had a hard time finding dresses that fit in my budget. It was pretty insulting and not very smart as my change room backed directly onto where they were talking in the back. Also, because of the lack of full walls you can smell employees microwaving their lunches. Trying on bridal gowns and the smell of last night's pasta don't really go well together. \n\nAnother problem (at least in the room I was in) was that there is only a mirror in front of you and one way back in the change room behind you. There is no good way to see the front and back of the dress. I've never seen this at another bridal store. Furthermore, the pedestals are not secured to the floor in any way (more like stools just placed there) making them very hazardous when you're stepping off in big, long gowns and heels. \n\nAt the end of my appointment, my party and I stayed to look at the mother of the bride dresses. My consultant made no attempt to say goodbye to me to close the appointment. I had to go back and find her to say thank you. Even though she could probably tell that I wasn't buying a dress, it's still good practice to make sure the customer leaves with a good feeling. They could still recommend the store to their friends and family or shop their for bridal party or mother of the bride dresses--two things I definitely won't be doing. \n\nIf you are looking for places to buy a dress in Durham region, I would consider shopping elsewhere. There are lots of other nice stores and boutiques with much more professional service and better selection.", "date": "2015-10-19 13:43:33"}

Pretty cheap.\n\nSushi eating as a vegetarian generally has less options, and this place didn't have many different vegetarian rolls.. or fancy vegetarian rolls like dragon rolls.  The veggie sushi that they did have was really good though.  \n\nTheir sushi pizza is definitely the best sushi pizza I have ever had.  Most places I've been to have either had sushi pizza that was so greasy it was wet, or so soggy because of the sauces on top.  This one was perfect.  It had some sort of delicious marinated mushrooms on top which made it really yummy.\n\nAnother thing i like about this place is the way you can order tempura.  You can order it one piece at a time which is good for me since I don't usually want three pieces.  \n\nThe service was also really good... We got seated fast (but be aware weekends is way busier) and had most of our food right away.  The servers are also very polite and kind.  \n\nThe restaurant is really small.  That's probably the only downfall.  I went a couple weeks on a Sunday and it was so busy, and extremely loud because everyone is so.. close together.

The bathroom walls sadly need a fresh coat of bright paint - the restaurant decor is fine but when you walk into the women's washroom, you feel like you've entered into some other grimy business. As far as food - the scallops were what you'd find in most average Japanese restaurants downtown, the tempura was hot and fresh, so that was nice. Nothing was terrible, just not really any different from what a larger (and cheaper $15.99 for lunch with no sashimi? Really?) place would offer.

A few holes have huge risk reward decisions, such as laying up before a creek 219 yards away dog left or taking a chance and going for it.

The hockey puck of pork was dry and felt as if it had been compressed with a patty maker.\nThis has put me off of BK for now .", "date": "2016-07-21 16:12:44"}

She lives in Pickering, and so at least once a month I get to trek out East to experience a different dining atmosphere.  \n\n22 is a converted-house-restaurant.  It is very quaint, and there are not many tables (probably can seat about 100 at maximum capacity), but I like it! The parking lot in the back is quite small, but it's free!  When we entered the restaurant, there was no hostess at the front to greet or seat us, so we wandered upstairs and then back down and bumped into a waitress en route, and she said she'd be with usin a minute.  We were seated on the second floor (be careful on the stairs, as they are quite steep, and so if you're taking grandma out for a fancy dinner, avoid this place, or make a reservation on the main floor!).  I must say that although the food is 4 stars, the service was more like 2 stars.  The server didn't do a very good job at checking up on us, and was MIA a few times when we needed her.\n\nI ordered the 22 Salad to start, which is mixed greens served with roasted red peppers, tomato, blue cheese and a pomegranate vinaigrette.  My DC had the Caesar Salad.  For mains, I got the Bouillabaisse, while my DC opted for an 8 oz New York Striploin which came with your choice of sides (salad, potatoes or rice pilaf).  I must say that my Bouillabaisse was quite flavorful, but I've had better.  For starters, their calamari was very chewy, and I think I would've rather had a Bouillabaisse with fish as a substitute to the calamari. There were also scallops (which were very soft and tender) and shrimp (pretty substantial size!)  Overall it was good.  However, with most restaurants, you get bread to soak up the sauce after, which was not provided at 22.  Hey, what do we know at 22 right? \n\nMy DC enjoyed her steak, and it came with a generous serving of sides.  She opted for the garlic-roasted potatoes.\n\nIn terms of drinks, my DC got a half litre of their house white, and we both also ordered teas.  Their dessert selection is very small, with only 2 desserts available for the day (no dessert menu, the server will just tell you what they are).  It was either a Chocolate Peanut Butter Cake or a Mango Raspberry Swirl Cheesecake. We opted for the latter.\n\nI must say that the cheesecake was one of the best I've ever had.  Unlike most restaurant cheesecakes that weigh you down because they're so heavy on the cream cheese, this one was nice and light, and the cheesecake crust was out of this world!\n\nOur total bill came up to about $94 with tax (but before tip).

Daughter didn't like the breakfast that was offered at the hotel we were staying at. Hubs ordered the Spinach and cheese crepes. He asked the waitress what kind of cheese was in the crepes and the kitchen told her it was Swiss. It wasn't Swiss, it was cheddar. Hubs wasn't impressed with the crepes because he didn't think it tasted like crepes, but it's good to try new things. He thought it tasted like gluten free and mochi-like texture. He thought it was ok but wouldn't order it again. Daughter ordered the Eggs Florentine Benny with Deep fried fries. The fries were nice and crispy. It was best order of our 3. She got 4 poached eggs instead of 3 and she liked it a lot. Finally, I ordered Belgian Waffle with Whipped Cream and Nutella . The Nutella was drizzled on top of the waffle. I liked it a lot.

I highly recommend this venue for brides to be but I would ensure that there isn't another wedding booked on the same day/time.

I did not end up purchasing my dress here even though there was one dress I said I was 95% sure about (5% can go a long way!), but I really want to let everyone know how wonderful my experience was with them! I was drawn to this store as all their reviews on Yelp, Google and Facebook were all positive (everyone on Google gave them 5 stars!). Bridal Desires is definitely a hidden gem in a back corner of a plaza in Ajax (it deserves to be more visible!!). I didn't expect it to be so fancy and cute when we stepped in! We came in way earlier than expected as we were trying to avoid rush hour traffic. Maggie at the front desk was very welcoming when we came in. The weird thing is that they make you take your shoes off so that you don't drag dirt in and get it on the wedding dresses. They do offer slippers, but I would've brought my own if I knew. I didn't have socks on so I opted to walk around bare foot. \n\nWe asked Maggie if we could look at dresses for bridesmaids while we were waiting for the rest of our group, and she was very helpful in showing us an album of swatches from different designers and then showing us the beautiful dresses they had in stock. She was very knowledgeable and patient with us as she let one of my bridesmaids try a couple of dresses on.\n\nMy consultant was Kashika, whom I have heard all good things about in the reviews, so I was definitely excited. Kashika was knowledgable herself and super nice! I had a great time working with her and really appreciated that her patience never broke even though there were times when I was being indecisive and was sure she would break, even just a little. But Kashika was so understanding and knows how important it is for a bride to find the right wedding dress. I tried on 5 dresses in total, including a ball gown style, which she knew I've never tried and was staying away from. But she believed that brides should try different styles at least once. Even though I knew a ball gown would not do for a destination wedding in Mexico, it was absolutely beautiful and made me feel like a princess, so I was glad I got to just see myself in it! \n\nKashika was amazing at completing my look by taking the time to add belts, veils, hairpieces & jewelry. She even did simple styles with my hair but it looked gorgeous! My team of mom, aunt and 2 bridesmaids loved everything Kashika did. The only thing was that the fitting rooms are tiny and you're expected to put the dresses on by yourself, which can get tricky, and then call the consultant for the zipping/lacing up. Kashika was always nearby and would check up on me often so I only really had to call for her once or twice. The fitting room at least had a mirror and chair so I'll give them that! They have a beautiful 3-way mirror and pedestal for you to stand on when you come out and you're allowed to take pictures, which is super helpful for the decision-making process!\n\nI definitely recommend checking out Bridal Desires for wedding dresses. They have lovely and affordable collections between $1,400-$2,000 and they even have a clearance sale rack with dresses that are only a couple hundred bucks! Their bridesmaids dresses are also really nice and I've read great reviews for them as well, but I am personally opting for dresses that are way cheaper than the average $150-200 since I am having a destination wedding. All in all, wonderful service and beautiful dresses - you won't be disappointed!", "date": "2014-08-21 03:54:06"}

The location closes at 2 PM and when I arrived at 1 PM, waited about 45 minutes before the manager was able to see me. I mentioned my reservation and he told me that they had zero vans and by showing up at nine minutes to 2, there wasn't much he could do. He then showed me 3-5 passenger SUV's but I declined as they too small. That was the end of the conversation as he had other customers waiting. I then scrambled and was fortunate to find a van through the Enterprise Toronto airport location which I picked up the next morning. Thank you folks! I called Enterprise Corporate who informed me that the 2 vans the Ajax location had, were rented 2 hours before. In other words, unless the Ajax branch made other arrangements to get another van, there was never a chance of my reservation being fulfilled. Without any communication, I find Enterprises business practices suspect as I have asked if they purposely over book as a matter of course to insure higher fulfillment rates at the expense of customer satisfaction. When I asked the Area Manager about this he said this is not standard practice but I wonder how many people have had this issue within the industry? Anyway, Enterprise has shaken my confidence over this and I shown up to tell the local manager they have lost a customer. To the airport location who helped me, thank you for your assistance. It was appreciated.", "date": "2016-07-08 17:18:30"}

Was really looking forward to a great burrito place that was in my area. I was VERY disappointed.\n \nMy LARGE burrito was not LARGE in my opinion.

So not only did it cost more, the portion was far less than the competition.\n\nThis place is SOOOOOOO  cheap on toppings. The amount of cheese they put on my burrito was laughable.

We were actually at the other salon when one of my bridesmaids called Bridal Desires, told them that we were having a very poor experience and could they take us that afternoon? They readily accepted the appointment and my bridesmaid surprised me by telling me they'd found another place for us to go.\n\nWhen we walked in, we were warmly greeted by the staff and they gave me a quick tour of the store while the girls and my mom looked around a bit. I was introduced to my consultant, Mandy, who showed my girls and my mom to our semi-private room, and then took me out onto the floor to discuss what I wanted. I will say, I definitely appreciated the semi private room. the only thing that didn't make it totally private was the lack of a door, but really, doesn't make a difference!! I felt like I had the store to myself and it was lovely to not have to be on parade for a bunch of strangers.\n\nMandy and I discussed my budget and the type of dress I was looking for (no lace, very sparkly, different and fit and flare style) and she showed me a few things to gauge what I liked and didn't like. She showed me back to the room and very politely told me 'we're going to get to know each other real well today! what size bra are you' and informed me that the strapless bra I was wearing wasn't going to be enough support for me (she was right). She got me fitted into a corset and then we started trying on dresses.\n\nThere are a ton of \"best parts\" of this visit: \n1) Mandy did me up into every single dress - every single loop was done up and she actually put me INTO the dress and pulled them tight so I knew what I was getting into \n2) She made sure I had a grand entrance with every single dress, she would pull back the curtains and ask my ladies \"are you ready?!\" and then I'd get to enter and get up on the pedestal \n3) The pedestal is KEY, you need the extra height because the dresses are longer (I'm only 5'6\") and it really helped to highlight the shape of the dress and how it would fall \n4) She put me in a variety of dresses, even some I would have never considered trying. It was nice to see myself in something different than I'd envisioned and it made me realize how many options I had.\n5) The rooms had dimmers, so when I came out in the super sparkly dresses, she dimmed the lights a bit so you could see how it would look at the reception. I loved this because it wasn't the standard florescent lighting and it helped to highlight the details of each dress\n6) I didn't have to wait to be jacked up. Mandy immediately brought in belts and earrings and held them up so I could get a whole look. She also put my hair up with the first dress so that it was back from my face for every dress I tried on. \n\nI found my dress that afternoon and purchased it on the spot. I can't say enough about how wonderful Bridal Desires was for my wedding dress. We returned a few months later to purchase my bridesmaids dresses and unfortunately, Mandy wasn't available. The other consultants were good but not as good as Mandy and I felt like they weren't as focused on us. However, my bridesmaids dresses turned out gorgeous and the girls were all happy too.", "date": "2017-01-12 16:34:42"}

Everyone has their favorite easy to cook the eggs, style of potatoe and method to cook bacon. Here they serve homefries that are large cut and very thin sliced bacon (both deep fried). My wife likes her bacon crispy but I prefer a little softness which is impossible deep fried. I enjoy a crispy outside of my potatoes which were cooked well.

We came in for takeout and there were maybe 3 people ahead of us and it took a while for us to get served.  Not sure why as everything that people ordered was already cooked so they just needed to put them in to containers.  It wasn't as if there was only one person behind the counter.  Not only that but when I was being rung up I asked for some extra sauce on the side as they only gave one small container.  I wanted an extra one as I had just purchased a whole chicken.  I went to pay and realized the price was higher than what it should have been and when I asked why the lady said the extra sauce was $1 more.  This was a little irritating as she didn't even bother to tell me until I asked her about it.  Not only that it's just bad business.

Aside from the incredibly poor quality (things are cut off everywhere), they don't even offer all the items! I tried ordering nachos for example, but they just don't do them. \n-They answer the phone with \"Hello?\", and don't try to properly take your order at all. After asking for the single deal combo, they just said \"OK\"... So I had to go through telling them the flavors I wanted, type of pop etc.\n-When we went to pick up the order, they didn't know it came with coleslaw... Even though it's listed clearly with the combo I ordered. Waited around for them to grab that, which ended up being about 2 fork fulls of slaw.\n-The wings themselves are pretty good, I'll hand then that, but I made the horrible mistake of trying Gar Par fries. You know that terrible texture/taste fries get when you microwave them? Yeah.... They absolutely microwaved them. Almost inedible if it weren't for the sauce on top. \n-Not that I've stayed to eat there, but it's a wing joint that's not even licensed! Other Wow Wings are, and operate much like a Wild Wings. Not this place, it's just super sketchy hole-in-the-wall kind of place.\n\nSeriously, save yourself the disappointment - go to Magwyer's or the Portly Piper nearby instead - they're both amazing.", "date": "2016-02-22 12:42:21"}

It was somewhere we actually enjoyed sushi in ajax when we didn't want to drive all the way to Toronto. \n\nI've had 2 consecutive horrible experiences here. The first time, we were doing the ayce menu when the manager/owner came out and scolded us for ordering too much. He continued to say how if we order like this he won't have any food left to serve other customers. I used to work at an ayce restaurant and was already well aware about the left over food issue they have. But because my boyfriend and I both know how much we eat, we weren't ordering unreasonable amounts of food. When we asked for the bill, we noticed that the gratuity was already added onto the bill, which they never used to do. So we asked again why there was gratuity already included, and yet again the same guy started yelling at us about how we're supposed to tip and what not. I always tip more than I should, but I refused to tip this time. I didn't even get to finish my meal! \n\nA few months later we decided to give this place another shot. We came in with our family at 8pm (they closed at 10 so i wasn't sure why last call was so early) and was told that it was last call and that we should order everything in one order. So we did. Mind you, there were 5 of us, 3 of them were guys who eat a fairly large amount, so the order did appear to be excessive. And then the same guy from before came out and started getting mad at us, saying we ordered too much. He specifically said \"you only pay $30 you're ordering too much\". Sorry, but I thought this was all you can eat??? \n\nAnyways, I won't be returning again. I'd rather drive to Toronto than deal with that again.", "date": "2018-07-13 14:48:19"}

This was somewhat expected which is fine, however a few days before the clinic called us letting us know she no longer was required to have the blood work done. This was good news considering it would save us about $350. The day of the procedure I dropped her off in the morning and the girl was kind and reassured me i could call anytime for updates on her. About an hour later however, I got a call from the main vet there who said he refused to proceed with the surgery because she had lost about 20% of her weight since her last appt 2 months ago. We were told she was overweight in her last appointment so we have been putting her on diet kibble and walking her more, so the weight loss was to be expected. There was no mention of her weight being unhealthy, merely that it was just too much of a decrease in the timespan. He also mentioned that she should of been put on an antibiotic and a few days before the surgery, of which there had been no communication or mention of at all before. He also stated she should have had bloodwork done, which we were originally were going to do had they not called to tell us it was unnecessary. (My dog has also had previous dental surgery at this clinic from about 2 years ago, so we are not new clients here). The problem I had is that there was no communication or proper assessment of her case before her surgery. It doesn't make any sense that I had taken the day off work and arranged to be available to pick her up, which was difficult considering I have two jobs, only to be told all this the day of the procedure. During the phone call he said \"he didn't want to be liable if anything were to happen\" and I implied I would be very upset if [my dog] died. When I went to go pick up my dog I was asked to step outside to have a conversation since they had no rooms available to which I respectfully declined and requested that we just have Chloe's medical history printed out. The nurse who accompanied me agreed and was curt as she replied we \"had nothing to talk about\" and that \"we were on the same page\". I left feeling very slighted and that the staff were unapologetic despite the disorganization on their behalf. I apologize for the lengthy entry, however I just wanted to make it known what happened accurately.

As I came closer to the counter I could see around the wall there was a dine in area with a few tables and patrons being served as well what looked like a large family dinner/party ending and being cleaned up. I was here to get some take out though so I glanced above to the menu board before making my choice.\n\nI was warmly greeted by a lady behind the counter who patiently waited while I made my decision. I decided to keep it standard and just went with two half chicken dinners and a small greek salad. There were a few ladies behind the counter all busy prepping food. It was nice to see the open kitchen and chicken being freshly grilled and cooked. My order was ready within minutes and she kindly packaged it all up for me.\n\nDriving home I could hardly wait to dig in.\nUpon opening our containers of food Hubby and I were both astonished by the amount food we received. They definitely are very generous here. Four hearty pieces of juicy chicken laying upon a bed of vegetable rice and a mound of parisienne potatoes all drapped in that delicious peri peri sauce.\nFirst of all the chicken was the true highlight of the meal it was sooo incredibly juicy and tender with a crispy skin and subtle smokiness to it. Oh and the sauce my god I'm hooked! (ok maybe the sauce was the real winner) It was tangy, lemony, creamy, and little spicy. The meal comes with a small container of sauce as well. I couldn't help but dunk every morsel of meat into it and those crispy little parisienne potato balls were just the perfect bites for dunking! The vegetable rice adorned with peas and carrots was well seasoned and just the perfect compliment to go with the chicken.\nWe also ordered a small greek salad on the side which was hefty enough for two to share and again they were soo generous on the feta and it came with a lemony oil based dressing on the side.\nI will definitely be making repeat trips here. Everything was delicious, fresh, hot and flavourful. Portions are very generous and prices are affordable especially for the amount of food you are getting. Next time I'll be sure to purchase a bottle of the sauce so I'll have ample for dipping and dunking always on hand.", "date": "2018-01-21 03:14:17"}

Big mistake. When you start questioning the become snobby and bitter, almost like what I say should go. Ahhh NO. My 7 year old daughter had two appointment since January and they used up her $1500 worth of benefits already. On what??!  They kept saying she needed this and that.. They did the same last year and while going to them for a couple times her benefits were up already..should of been a red flag then...but she was needing more work done. At 7 years old they put a crown and spacers on teeth that will fall out, and she had a spacer put in last year that fell out a few days later and then when we went back was told she didn't need it back in because her new tooth is coming through, they said they can see it in the x-ray. after spending $300. When I asked my daughter if she can feel anything coming through she says no. I asked the dentist when will her tooth come through oh in the next year or two LOL ok but the spacer was needed at first then not needed when it fell out a couple days later. Who taught you, lady??? Anyways my daughter's last treatment was for a pulled tooth, crown, sedative and moulding for a spacer, $1200. Every time she had an appointment apparently she needed the sedative so had to be there an hour earlier and she needed it for cavities. Sheesh, I mean I remember going to the dentist when I was young and i got a needle to freeze it. So they haven't finished all her work after that hefty bill and scheduled another appointment. The day before I called the dentist to see what she was getting done and what the cost would be so i could be prepared since her benefits ran out already and now weren't renewed until the next year in january. Well she is only coming in for an X-ray and a cleaning. What I said, why would they do that when she apparently has two more fillings? So I have to pay for that and then schedule another appointment to take care of those fillings and let me guess she will have something else wrong.. I read up that we don not need X-rays, only every 2 years or so and yet they have done it about 3 times in a year. Well stupid me, poor child getting all this radiation and these dentists do not care all they want is a fat cheque. PLEASE if anyone knows of an awesome dentist in Durham area Ontario please let me know. One that is honest and not greedy and actually cares about their patients. Im so sick of what these dentists can do. I think I'm going to call up the better business bureau and see what they say. Can a real dentist look over my child's records and see if she really needed this expensive crap done. Beware of this place people please, another red flag, THEY MAKE YOU PAY UP FRONT....I mean $1200, thats like  mortgage payment. Greedy scams. My child flosses,brushes and mouthwashes and barely eats junk, figure that one out. NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL.", "date": "2016-02-24 02:11:40"}

The atmosphere and the food is much more fresher. The plate of bean spout they provide seems alot more fuller with more basil and lemon. They have fresh chilli unlike pho metro that only gives you frozen chilli only if you ask for it. As for price, they are practically the same price with the price of the XL special pho bowl being $9.00 (and change). As for service.. it a pho restaurant.. it's just a bowl of noodles with soup, that is all there is and it comes out fast! in my opinion, I have decided today to switch my pho restaurant.", "date": "2017-06-06 22:01:51"}

To be honest, I probably wouldn't have given it a second thought myself, had it not come highly recommended by a fellow Yelper.\n\nI don't live in Ajax so it's unlikely for me to notice new and exciting restaurants to try but after receiving the recommendation, I added it to my 'to do' list and finally found myself here last night for dinner.\n\nThe restaurant seats nearly 30 people and although I reckon they have a large 'take-out' customer base, it was really nice to be able to just sit and enjoy our dinner. We settled on Shish Kabab and Chicken Tandoori Kabab but were also fortunate enough to try the Mantoo.\n\nIf you haven't tried Mantoo before, which I hadn't myself, I highly recommend giving it a go. In layman's terms it's dumplings filled with ground beef and onions served with the most delicious seasoned yogurt. It was light but satisfying and I'm sure I would be happy to just dine on that alone for dinner. The yogurt it was served with was incredible and, with manners simply forgotten, I used my naan to soak the rest of it up! Not a drop was to be wasted.\n\nEach of the Kabab dishes were served with rice, a small dish of yogurt, salad and naan. The meat was so tender and cooked to perfection! Everything about our dishes was fantastic... from the salad to the naan.\n\nThere's something special about Afghan rice that I have never been able to replicate at home so when the owner came to check on us I engaged him in conversation with hope that he might reveal his secrets.\n\nHalfway through the rice cooking instructions I suspected I was being led on a wild goose chase to which the moral of the story would end up being, it's just easier to come here for dinner where the works already been done!\n\nI tend to agree.\n\nWhen we had finished our meal I was left with an odd feeling that I just couldn't put my finger on... and then it hit me. I truly felt as though I should be in a larger restaurant, one where I would've had to have made reservations. The presentation and taste of the food was unlike any other 'fast food' joint.\n\nThey certainly take pride in what they do and they value their customers.

Balanced Life is conveniently located right by the 401 for Eastenders, and the building is rather easy to spot, since there is not much else around. \n\nThey have a large space on the second floor, and everything seems new, and maybe even a little sparse, but upon entry I didn't feel like I was walking in a yoga studio. I'd give them a little slack, however, since it's one of the very few studios in the East part of the GTA.  \n\nI'm constantly alarmed, however, with a very small number of studios that offer hot yoga without having shower facilities on the premises. It not only is inconvenient, but it's a hazard for those who must then encounter smelly yogis after class. Balanced Life is unfortunately, one of these studios. \n\nThere is also no real changeroom. The 'changing' must be done in one of the two washrooms, which also double up as their storage space. Thankfully, however, everything is extremely clean. \n\nThe yoga class was one of the most memorable ever. Not so great in their case. I may be blissfully not 'with it', but when I think of yoga, I think of tranquility, peace and relaxation. This abominal yoga class began with pop music by artists like Black Eyed Peas (their club songs), Lady Gaga (*not* the acoustic versions...!) and K'naan, all with the bass blaring. It was extremely difficult to find peace in any of my positions, let alone attempt a steady Ujjayi breath rhythmn. In fact, my friend and I couldn't stop laughing out of shock when the music first started playing. \n\nTowards the end of the practice, the instructor offered a small neck massage. I had no idea that the massage would be done using muscle numbing cream, like tiger balm. I find it totally counterproductive to numb your muscles after yoga, since the entire point of yoga is to be more aware of your body & surroundings. If muscles are sore, I'd rather be aware of that. \n\nAll in all, this could be a more than moderate yoga studio if they make some important changes.", "date": "2010-03-17 22:35:41"}

Since it would be a shorter drive than to Pho Metro, we decided to give it a try, hoping that it would be good enough to be our go to Pho spot in Durham region.  \n\nWe each ordered an extra large house special Pho and a large satay beef Pho only because they don't offer a medium size.  We had a good chuckle thinking about why a restaurant would have a small, large and an extra large sizes instead of just simply having a small, medium and large.  Doesn't seem to make much sense to skip a medium and call it a large and their large, an extra large.  Anyways, I digress.\n\nThe noodles arrived fairly quickly and they were the broader and less chewy variety that I don't particularly enjoy.  My husbands extra large house special pho had some meatballs (upon partaking later, they were overcooked and chewy) and some cooked rare beef (which were also pretty tough).  Not the best cuts of meat were used and the meat portion was on a small side.  The broth was the standard out of package msg stuff that tasted like most pho broth.\n\nMy satay beef pho was the strangest version of the dish I had ever encountered at a pho restaurant.  The soup was thick and gooey from the large chunks of beef that had been coated in corn starch before being wok fried and added to the soup.  There was not enough satay sauce to really taste the satay but the gooey and goopy consistency of the broth was the most off putting thing about the noodle soup.  Overall, the noodle soup didn't taste bad, just poorly executed.  \n\nI'm not sure if we would go back to pho mono or just choose to do the extra 10 min drive up to Pho Metro.

You're here because you're making arrangements for a loved one, paying your respects to a friend or loved one who has passed or visiting with their family. No matter what, it's not a happy time. \n\nSo why 4 stars. Given recent circumstances in my personal life, this was my second time being here for a visitation/memorial and I must say the venue is lovely. The staff, easily the most empathetic people around (I mean empathy is their job) but really they go the extra mile to keep a grieving family on track and comfortable - anyone who has had the experience of losing a loved one that things can go off the rails pretty easily when emotions are involved.\n\nEven when it came to organizing the day of funeral procession, burial, etc they were wonderful and I know my family appreciated their help through it all.\n\nI can't speak to their pricing as I wasn't the one paying for their services but as a family member I can speak to their level of service and professionalism. I only withhold a single star for two reasons, not being aware of their pricing (which could be higher or lower than normal) and second the location is a bit awkward to get to given that it's on a one-way side street in Pickering Village.\n\nI hope I won't be back anytime soon (no one does), but if you're in the area and in need of assistance with final arrangements for your loved one, look no further these folks are wonderful to deal with and they will make the process of saying goodbye as seamless as possible.\n\nThanks again McEachnie team", "date": "2015-12-09 21:21:14"}

Taco shells, tortillas, chicken or beef, and you can pick your vegetables, sauce, and cheese toppings.\n\nI ordered the Crisp Beef Burrito,  and made a meal of it with their \"Mexi-fries\" and a drink, as well as a dessert of an apple empanada.  \nThe Crisp Beef Burrito was not a real burrito by definition as it did not contain any beans.  Basically it was spiced ground beef in a tortilla and deep fried.  No toppings, no vegetable content.  A little bland for my liking, however had very pleasant textures, especially the fried tortilla, very crispy.  \nI added some of their medium red hot sauce, but for me it lacked a vinegar/salt flavor.  I appreciate that the hot sauce is likely made in restaurant, and is in a squeeze bottle so that I can add it to anything, in whatever quantity I desire.\n\"Mexi-fries\" = Tater tots.  Meh.  I just had them plain, but you can have them made Deluxe.  (With sour cream, cheese and salsa, a la fries supreme at Taco Bell.) \n\nThe real star was the dessert, the apple empanada, They took apple pie filling  (Likely from a can) and rolled it in the same tortilla as the crisp beef burrito,  and deep fried it.  Then they covered it in a whole mess of cinnamon and sugar.  It was really good, again the texture of the tortilla is light and very crisp.  And quite large actually, the same size as my Beef Burrito.\n\nThe service from the couple that likely owns the place was great, they were very gracious, made recommendations,  (\"Try the hot sauce on the fries\", They suggested the  Crisp Beef Burrito as it was the more original item that stood out from the rest of the menu.)\n\nThey have a few tables and TV, so you can eat in or take out.  \nWould I go back?  Sure, if I'm in the area.", "date": "2012-11-12 03:24:37"}

I fell in love with the then called \"Crisp meat burrito\" which is now called \"Crisp beef burrito\".  Sadly I can no longer enjoy that burrito since I now have to avoid beef due to gout.\n\nNow in the present, I was surprised to actually stumble across the Taco Time in Ajax.  The menu is vastly different from my days in Jr High.  I ordered Mexi-fries (which are essentially tater-tots), 1 cod fish soft taco and 1 chicken soft taco for my wife, along with a chicken taco salad which we shared.\n\nThe cod fish taco was tasty, but messy to eat, wasn't exactly appealing to the eyes at first opening the wrapper.  The soft taco shell itself had gotten stuck to the wax paper wrapper.  This cod fish option was at least much to my taste against the Wendy's Cod fish sandwich which was too salty to my taste buds..\n\nMy wife enjoyed the chicken soft taco.  Tho the amount of chicken included in the soft taco could have been more, considering the price paid.\n\nI'd rate the chicken taco salad taste/quality at about 3.5 out of 5.  I did enjoy it to a certain degree, tho it was kind of hard to swallow the $7.99 price point attached to it.  \n\nThe mexi-fries (large size) which we ordered was poor in regards to price point to portion size.  $3.99 for the large mexi-fries where we could have ordered about 1 large and 1 medium fries no-salt at a Wendy's or McDonalds.  The portion size was too small in my opinion for $3.99.  The medium salsa was available from the counter via a squeeze bottle instead of packets so that is a plus.  There are 4 spice levels now for their sauce vs just Mild and Spicy from back in the day.  Hehe since I can't hold my spice as well any more I just opted for the lowest but still had flavor (enchilada sauce)\n\nThis is my first Taco Time meal since 1993 and it hit the wallet for $30.00 bux CAD.  Jeez inflation sux,  Back in the day, 3 hard/soft tacos and mexi-fries would have only been around $5 - $6 bux CAD.  \n\nAs for a repeat visit, that is still up in the air, not sure as of this writing.  Tho I would venture to say that I prefer it over Taco Bell..tho that probably isn't saying a lot.", "date": "2017-07-23 03:05:42"}

Pulled into this small little place and you just felt like you were at home.  The place felt very cozy and warm, with the not only friendly loyal parsons but the wait staff.  While I was in line, waiting for my friend, I was having a chat with this couple who kept raving about their food.  They go here very often and they said that each time, there's always a wait yet was well worth it.  They were right.  Mind you, we only really waited for about 20 minutes, which isn't so bad.  We were waited on by the lovely Betty and it seemed like her and all her colleagues just loved working there.  I wouldn't be surprised if they've been working there for a long time either.  The place just yelled out \"loyal\".  \n\nAfter my friend and I had a little misunderstanding on what to order (I thought we were going to share an eggs benny and pancakes, she made it clear that if she's going to hell for having a cheat day, she's going to hell with a bang and not sharing an eggs benny), we each ordered an eggs benny and shared a single serving of pancake.  Yes, pancake - singular. I'll get to that in a  bit.\n\nTraditional Eggs Benny - While in line, one of the friendly patrons explained Angelique's generosity; if you ask for 3 eggs, they'll give you 4.  Well, usually eggs benny comes with 2 poached eggs, but their came with 4.  On top of that (or should I say, underneath) were 3 thick, lean slices of peameal bacon and 2 slices of English muffin.  All covered in their hollandaise sauce.  I say this overtime I get eggs benny and that is that I'm a picky eggs benny eater.  Although I'm picky, I will order it almost every time I see it on the menu that ranges from a greasy spoon/hole in the wall type of restaurant or at a Four Seasons restaurant.  This was one of the better ones at a greasy spoon type of place that I've tried.  Not to mention, a very generous one.  One thing I do wish was a little bit more flavour to the hollandaise sauce, perhaps a just a wee bit more lemon flavour.  Regardless, I'd order this again or will try another one. 5/5.\n\nHash Brown  - My friend and I opted for their hash brown to go with my Eggs Benny.  Very smart choice. If you love r\u00f6sti type of hash browns, then this is a must try.  Would've been nice to have a more evenly crispiness, but it was still very good and also a very generous serving.  I only had a quarter of mine since I ate all of my eggs benny. 5/5.\n\nPancake - As I was waiting, I was creepily and hungrily watching this man butter something from a distance.  What caught my attention was how widely he was buttering whatever it was.  I tiptoed to get a better look and it was a gigantic piece of pancake.  One of the lovely lady patrons told me that if you order a single order, it's a really big one.  This thing was pretty much as big as the plate.  Was also pretty fluffy. Definitely a great choice to satisfy those pancake cravings. 5/5. \n\nCoffee - Any and all breakfast joints NEEDS to have a great cup o'joe and theirs was also good.  Was like having a cup at home. 5/5. \n\nNow I see why they have many patrons.", "date": "2016-11-27 19:23:10"}

Well, that's harsh. It looked like the dog sausage that I had in Vietnam a few months earlier. Why the chrorizo isn't shredded beats the hell out of me. I ask for it loaded with anything spicy on it. Jalapenos do actually look fresh! But everything else was bland as fuck. \n\nI ask for Quac. Oh, that will be 99 cents. Fuck that. But yet I ask for it \"smothered\". Of course, at an outrageous upsell price of $1.50. I assume I am getting something like an enchilada, with flavorful sauce and cheese, but alas, no. \n\nThey throw the food in a disposable plastic container and charge me $35 for 3 burritos and 3 drinks. This better be fucking good. It wasn't.\n\nThe \"smothering\" sauce tasted like basic prego/marinara sauce. The entire burrito had no flavor. It tasted like a really crappy bland vegetarian burrito I could get at some federal government building cafeteria. I don't know how else I can describe the mediocrity. \n\nToronto is not a \"Mexican food desert\", even though 4 star reviews for a place as shitty as this probably reflects a lack of Mexican food experience. For a city with so few Mexicans, there are actually some great options. This is not one of them. This falls short even by Calgary standards.", "date": "2012-02-11 01:27:05"}

We went for 10am and had to stand in line outside to get in. But, the line moved quickly.  We had a table within 10minutes. \n\nAs you'll see from the pics on their yelp page the servings are huge.  I got the combo breakfast with hash browns, bacon and sausage, and blueberry pancakes. It had four eggs when it came.  \n\nAbout the food, I liked most of it. I found the hash browns flavourless. There was no seasoning. It tasted watered down. I didn't enjoy them.  I did like the home fries my friend got, so if I go back, I'll get those instead. The pancakes were ok. They were dense and heavy.  So I wasn't able to eat much of them.  My friend had steak and eggs and she enjoyed her meal. \n\nThe coffee was pretty good. They give you a nice big mug!  \n\nThe service was excellent. The wait staff were really good, quick and friendly.  \n\nThe ambiance was very nice.

Eventually staff came out and told us that kitchen (for the hot stuff) wasn't making anything. They probably lost our order- what did we order, please? But what about the cold - the sushi, I asked? Why was it taking an hour in an empty restaurant? Staff pretended not to hear or understand me and tried to leave. Until I demanded an explanation. Other staff (sushi prep) came out and said it was because they were busy. I pointed out that restaurant was empty but for us. He looked around and said maybe there was a lot of takeout. I saw no takeout while I was there, and one delivery go out. BS. \n\nSo he hugged me and said I should be happy, it was going to be okay. \n\nWe cancelled most of the rest of the order, since we weren't really hungry anymore. \n\nNo consideration of giving us a discount for bad service and not bringing us most of the food we ordered. \n\n$80 for two adults and an 8 year old to have sake, iced tea, gyoza, a few rolls and a dragon roll and ice cream. \n\nThey were happy to take our money. \n\nI used to be here once a month.

Because of the many positive reviews (and pictures) I was adamant on trying this place. Let me just say, I was not disappointed. The atmosphere was cute, a little old (with vintage interior and decor) but definitely warm, comforting and family friendly. Upon arrival, we were greeted with huge smiles and given the option to sit anywhere we liked. Our server was very kind, helpful and continued to have a positive attitude all throughout our time being there (she was always on her feet and left positive remarks about everything). She had also mentioned Angeliques was owned by a family and the husband himself was one of the cooks in the kitchen (which I loved since it's a family owned business). \n\nOnto the food, I ordered the Philly cheesesteak eggs benedict (with no peppers/$15.95) and since then it has been my go-to everytime I'm there. The steak was juicy, the eggs made perfect and the hollandaise sauce was unlike any other (personally, I find it hard to come across good hollandaise sauce which is why I say this). This breakfast came with home fries and baked beans which was more than enough for my appetite. While my partner ordered the steak eggs benedict ($15.95) and had nothing to complain about except for that he was happily full. All in all, the service provided is exceptional, the food even better and my favourite part, their portions are huge making it worth the money (and trip). \n\nAny downsides?

Things like flowers are discussed, casket choices, urn choices, what the deceased should wear in the casket (if it is open etc).  There are a lot of delicate decisions that one has to make and this place makes it very easy (well I guess that is their job and industry so it should be easy).\n\nThe funeral procession, cremation in addition to the viewings and the initial sit down to discuss what the family wished for the deceased was handled with 100% professionalism and sensitivity.  The staff were very respectful and made a difficult situation much easier to handle.  They handled the death certificates (asking how many copies we needed and then reaching out when the certificates were ready for pick up etc).", "date": "2016-05-03 01:19:30"}

Please, steer clear of this company, find another dog training company anywhere else.\n\nWe went to a puppy \"gymboree\" (meet and greet) with our 8 week old puppy and left with the absolute worst experience. The puppies and their owners were placed into a room with toys and treats and were allowed to play and socialize with one another.\n\nWe took our (large breed) 8 week old puppy to this class where we met with the trainer. As soon as we walked in we were met with rude and condescending remarks about the appearance of our (large breed) dog. We were immediately told that the breed of our dog would have behavioural and aggression issues and will be a liability his whole life.\n\nOnce the puppies began to play and socialize with the other dogs and an interaction didn't go as planned (we're talking about puppies here), she berated the owner, grabbed the leash and dragged the puppy away. In some cases she basically dragged the puppy by the neck through the floor. It was extremely uncalled for and all the owners were shocked. When owners asked on how to deal with any issues the puppy may have, she scolded them saying \"this isn't a training class\" and were told to drag the puppy into the corner (in order to punish them).\n\nWhen our puppy got into a growling match over a toy with several other dogs, we were told to leave due to owning an \"aggressive\" dog. My wife left in tears and was told to contact large dog breed trainers that specialize in aggressive dogs.\n\nEvery single trainer we called told us the same thing. A dog is never aggressive at such a young age of 8 weeks and told ignore this incompetent dog trainer.\n\nIt's been almost 2 years since this incident and I'm happy to report that our \"aggressive\" dog has had absolutely 0 issues. He has met and interacted with dogs every single day since we've had him, probably totalling well over 1000+ dogs and owners, usually off leash, without incident. He's a regular at the dog park, crowded festivals, incredibly gentle with small dogs and kids, everything we had hoped for. He's an incredible dog.\n\nIf you're looking for a dog trainer, please look elsewhere. This company and trainer isn't interested in dogs, she's interested in pumping the most amount of docile dogs through her class in order to maximize her profits without any issues. She's an embarrassment to the dog community and should not be anywhere near these loving creatures.", "date": "2018-06-04 20:26:12"}

Hubby found great Yelp reviews on this place and while in the area for a shopping trip last weekend, we decided to drop in for lunch.  \n\nIf you're here for a quick lunch, think again.  Our lunch order of mixed grills and a tandoori chicken wrap took just as long as it would have taken (15 - 20 min to get the food) had we gone to a regular sit down restaurant.  But I understand that it can take some time to cook up kabobs and that wonderful (not indian) naan bread.  Waiss, the owner, was very friendly and chatted with hubby while our babe and I checked the place out for a high chair and a change table.  \n\nIt's funny how after becoming parents, our decision on where to dine are made largely based on two things:  Do they have high chairs?  And do they have a change table?  This may not be important for everyone but for parents with little ones still in diapers, it can be a matter of having a relaxing lunch vs shovel it in as quick as possible lunch.  And unfortunately, most fast food joint do not have change tables in their usually large washrooms.  Maimana was no exception and this made the lunch feel more rushed as we knew we would have to stop in at another place just to change her diaper.  \n\nNow on to the food.  As the previous reviews mentioned, the kabobs in the mix grill were well seasoned (to the typical Afghan style) and served in juicy yumminess...at least the chicken and the ground beef ones were.  The sirloin, in my humble opinion, could have been marinaded a little longer for tenderness as it was quite toothsome.  The condiments served with the meal were nice compliments to the grilled meat with my preference leaning to the smokier red sauce.  The tandoori chicken wrap was also tasty if not a little too salty for my taste buds. \n\nAnd I don't know why it happens so often to me but it happened again here....yes.  I didn't get my doogh and I didn't realize it until we left.  I will blame the missing drink on my mommy brain which was trying to have a fast-ish lunch while worrying about where to change a diaper.  But our friendly owner also forgot about it and seeing as we were the only patrons in the place, I guess we were all too preoccupied with something else that day.  \n\nI will be back to try out the rest of their menu when I'm in the area and hopefully get my doogh next time.", "date": "2014-01-29 18:47:27"}

The last time I tried to bring stuff in I had some brand new clothes with tags and they were not taken.

I tend to get the exact same thing every single time I go to Pita Pit because its guaranteed amazing and I know I'll like it. I ordered a Chicken Caesar pita and a drink, and I guess they had some kind of promotion going on because if you threw a ball into a net on the wall, you got a drink for free! Clearly I suck at basketball cause I didn't win. Anyways...\n\nThe girl behind the cash was very friendly and fast and we headed down to the other end to watch my pita being made. The girl who was doing the cooking was chatty and very nice and while we stood around watching my chicken and bacon cook, we munched on some of the pita chips and dipping sauce they had out. Loved this! I've never seen it at another pita pit but I got to try some of their new sauces, which were yum! \n\nI've been to other Pita places (even other Pita Pits) where they're stingy as hell with the toppings. I'm not paying $8 for a pita with nothing in it - I'm paying for the meat AND the toppings. No issues at this location! The girl asked what I wanted and asked how much \"stuff\" i'd be putting in because the romaine lettuce was the hardest to get into the pita and if I was piling stuff on, she'd put less so everything else fit. Another thing I've never seen before were seasonings to put right onto the meat on the grill! I added Garlic Plus seasoning to my chicken, they had a whole bunch of them, but never seen that before! I picked out my toppings and she put it all together and we were done! And a yummy pita it was!! \n\nOverall, you can't go wrong with this location. Super clean, very large and a great selection of fresh toppings, sauces and seasonings. The staff here were so very nice that I'd come back just for that aspect, as the Pita Zone near me has staff that behave weirdly.

Its a brand new location, so the actual gym is beautiful, clean, big, lots of equipment etc.  BUT the staff are the worst.  Not all, just the women.  I am a woman myself, so I'm not being sexist, but they are all clueless.  There is always about 5 working at the front behind the counter.  They do not look like they should be working at a gym--with their face plastered with makeup.  They are not helpful at all, I called to double check a class and they said yes its available.  I go to the gym, and no, its not on my membership.  There has been so much confusion with my membership, I wish I never signed up there.  First, I don't have access to all gyms, then they realize I do.  Then, they can't find my name in the system.  Then I ask for a towel and the girl stands there arguing with me that I don't have it, I have to pay $2.00.  It was pouring rain outside, I already changed into my yoga clothes, I parked quite far and the hot yoga was starting but still she persisted so I had to run out and got soaked before even going into hot yoga LOL. Next thing, regarding the towels, they had called some woman out who was in the office to speak to me. So nicely I told her the situation about how the girl over the phone earlier said I had it and that I just needed to come in and show my ID and they would fix it.  She then tells me, \"No, no one ever told you that.\" In my head I was like WTF--how can she tell me that no one told me this? I just walked away.  Pretty much, never going to this location, even though it is 3 minutes away from my house. I don't know about anyone else, but I would like to be working out with nice helpful people around me.

In and out, I drooled all the way home with the warm pizza in my lap.\n\nIt's very rare for me to eat pizza nowadays so I dug right in and yes it was delicious. Soft, warm and exactly what I expected. It was good, but did not blow my mind especially with all the hype I hear. The salad was insanely small for a regular- I don't know how this is a share dish. The dressing that came with it was probably heavier in grams than the salad itself. Thank goodness they don't mix it in for you.. the boneless bites were good. Nothing more to say than just good. After 2 slices (keep in mind these are the small square slices) and a bit of salad, I felt a huge stomach ache as it felt like my stomach was clogged. I felt super sick and heavy and couldn't continue on. \n\nPizza Hut? Definitely overhyped in my opinion. Maybe it's because I don't eat this stuff often but I've never felt such pain eating pizza before so I don't know.. of course the food wasn't bad.. only the aftermath was.", "date": "2018-03-13 16:10:26"}

The prices are cheap! Or are they?\n\nThey have this thing called an Honest to Goodness Fee where they automatically add 3% to your overall bill. Huh? What? Why? Why not just add the 3% to the menu prices? This strategy artificially makes the menu prices seem lower. In the overall scheme of things, 3% may not seem like a lot but the concept is suspect.

As everyone has said, the restaurant itself is modern and clean which is always good.  I like how they have delivery service (depending on a minimum order and distance) even though I haven't used it.  Having eaten hundreds if not thousands of bowls of Pho in my lifetime, I can say the Pho here is not too shabby.  I like their choice of flat noodles and the broth is flavourful with what you would expect from a Pho broth.  The reason I gave them a low rating is because I have ordered different noodle soup items from their menu (the Hue noodle) and a Thai beef stew and well, both of them were utter disappointments to say the least.  The problem wasn't that they were having and off day -- it's a fundamental problem.  It's their recipe.  Anyone who is Viet and has eaten a bowl of Hue noodles can attest that it is fundamentally different than Pho.  The flavours, the color of the broth, the noodles and the meats.  The bowl of Hue noodles I received was essentially Pho broth with a different type of noodle.  Not good at all. It's as if McDonalds released a new burger, charged a premium price for it and gave you a Big Mac but on a brioche bun.  Pho Mono should really not be selling this item as it is doing a MAJOR disservice to Viet cuisine by introducing people to a very FAUX bowl of noodles.  As for the Thai stew, let's just say a legit Viet restaurant wouldn't stray too far from its roots.  The funny thing is that Viet cuisine does have a stewed beef noodle item that is tomato based so I'm not sure why they needed to slap the THAI in front of it.  Again, it was essentially their house Pho broth with stewed beef.\n\nIf you're looking for Pho in Durham, this isn't a bad choice.  If you're looking for authentic Viet food, drive an extra 20 minutes and find some place in Scarborough or North York.", "date": "2018-04-01 21:35:17"}

BUT 2 weeks ago I got my volumes done with her and my eye was reacting that evening and the following week it was itchy burning red and puffy , I don't like making my tech feel bad and I had a close personal relationship with Talon that my heart felt bad to tell her I'm reacting . I showed my bf and asked him for advice and we both thought to sleep on it and see if it goes away on it's own, however I ignored all the signs and irritation for 2 weeks with these lashes still on me. I had a GUT feeling something was wrong as brushing my lashes felt like trying to brush through plastic and hard glue. Anyways I decided to get other lash techs opinions and got my lashes removed yesterday.. and OMG I DID NOT have volume lashes which are one lash and fanned with 2 3 or 4 lashes on the tip! There's no such thing as \"6D\" I paid TALON $160 for CLUSTERS which causes irritation and leads to eye INFECTION!! I called her up and TRIED to explain calmly what has been happening to my eyes and asked her if she used clusters on my lashes, which you can buy at Walmart for $2 comparable to strip lashes at shoppers drug mart .. And she denied the whole thing TALKED over me the whole time and BELITTLED me and the lash tech and swore at me multiple times, VERY UNPROFESSIONAL and I was a REGULAR customer praising and advertising her work on my social media even over our last phone conversation I praised her work but wasn't happy with the last service as she now damaged my natural lashes which have MOST ALL broken off ! And she didn't offer to service or help me instead told me to NEVER call her agin or goto her for service and I didn't even get my money back or service to correct the situation and then she hangs up on me and BLOCKS me from social media! WOW! Please be careful of the scammers out there! Just when you think you trust your lash tech they have no problem taking your money and deceiving you EVEN at the risk of your own health (eye infection) and damaged lashes !  Goto a lash tech who has GREAT customer service and cares for you! If they make you sign a contract stating no refunds... RED FLAG! You'll be in for a rude awakening! Well I hope this helps you make the right choice! Good luck and wish the best for your journey", "date": "2017-06-04 13:02:44"}

The prices are the lowest I've ever seen, but that's when they tell you that you get what you pay for. First time ever went here I would have the ribs I got no sides not even the dry old corn on the cob that they offer with every meal. I have the two for one coupons that's why we thought would give it a shot I know they are new. That's why we went 4 times before I'm writing this review. I realize they're new we gave them a shot potentially next summer when we come back from Florida they make it one more shot the consistency is not there if I'm watching not only my food going back but the tables that are around us going back that's not a good sign. One of the managers explained that is chefs were from Belleville or somewhere in that direction will that's fine I'm sorry but if your Chef you should be able to operate in any kitchen not just the one that you're working in now. That's what makes a chef a chef. I have to give it a two and I'm being very generous at this point I want this place to be my go-to place and it's not going to be I'm very disappointed for that because their prices are reasonable their wine is reasonable. The young lady that's always at the front counter that the hostess I'm not even sure what she's doing there I'm going to assume she's either the manager's daughter or the owner's daughter because she's definitely not doing what she's there for somebody like that that is standing there flipping her hair could be going in wiping down tables and that includes the edges young young folks because people like to spill stuff on the edges of tables and there's nothing more gross and getting up and you have slop from the previous customer on the front of your shirt. As I said the menu and the prices are fantastic definitely have to work out the Kinks potentially will give it another shot but consistency is key and if I can't walk in and get the exact same consistency for the exact same item every time I walk in. The problem. The ribs were okay but they baked the barbecue sauce on top of it as if it was like a meatloaf so it cracked and it just not right. Work through the Kinks and we'll give it another shot until then it's a two.", "date": "2018-09-22 03:10:16"}

If you find yourself in the old school part of Ajax on Harwood and you are in need of some groceries, then Sal's could fit the bill.  Keep in mind, this place is MAD ghetto looking.  The aisles are ridiculously tight, the clientele is animated, and the dry goods require a double check of the expiration date.\n\nSo what's good about it?  Hands down I have to say their meat counter is totally worth checking out.  I purchased some assorted cold meats for a tray yesterday and they were ridiculously cheap and totally fresh.

After a hilarious conversation with my wife about having ice cream for dinner at Marble Slab Creamery, which is in the same place. I saw the name, and I though, I should go and check this place's menu out at least. And that turned into trying it out. Ironically, the hook was Boolanee and Mantoo - which Wais, the proprietor, regrettably explained were sold out because a caterer had come and bought his entire stock for the day!\n\nThe main menu offerings are a variety of kebabs, which come in a meal with rice and a very nice green salad, and of course naan (bread). Now, almost every review of an Afghan restaurant I've seen comes with complaints about the bread because the name makes people think of (wonderful) Indian naan. Afghan bread is not the same, it's drier and tougher but it's useful as a utensil and is usually supplied with sauces that it is dipped in. It's delicious, but it isn't Indian naan.\n\nMy wife had their tandoori kebab, I had sultani kebab (which was a combo of a couple of options). The food was tasty, the meat well spiced and not greasy, and the bread a nice accompaniment, and refreshingly, not a massive piece of naan that either gets wasted or makes you eat too much.\n\nWe finished (with Wais' humourous insistence and a money-back guarantee) with firnee, a traditional Afghan dessert that's a little like panna cotta, flavoured with cardamon, rosewater, and pistachio. It's simple and delicious and a perfect end to a spicy meal. Had we nowhere else to go that night, I imagine I'd have sat for a whole lot of chai as well.\n\nI do hope as they gain footing the menu will expand to offer some more Afghan options besides kebab - qorma, qabili palaw, and sabzi would be awesome.", "date": "2013-07-10 15:11:44"}

Maybe just a grin. Then when we wanted to get the bill, we left the card there to pay for the longest time. Kinda like she forgot about us, then after she finally brought the machine over. She was holding the card machine and the coffee which she was going to the tables around to refill. Which to me is fine, but can she not try to jungle all the things at once. She was trying to put the card in the machine with one hand, clearly it was going no where.  Like either use both hands, put down the coffee. Or she can just let us do it! Not jus put it in half way and go,  you need to push it down further then walk away. After we finish paying for the meal, we jus let the recepits attach to the machine.

Really as good as China Town in Toronto and Markham.  This is real deal Chinese food (tasty, not too greasy, fresh veggies, sauces are tasteful with just the right amount of spice in the Szechwan and Flavour in their Black bean sauce - their curry's are good also).

I can't compare it to the Toronto location(s), but I thought it was great. Very clean, very quiet, not huge but a lot of options for moving tables for large parties while retaining some intimate corners.\n\nTables are stocked with extra chopsticks, sriracha/fish sauce/soy/chili etc., which is very convenient. I took my 5-year old; we tried the special vermicelli and a Pho Tai (medium). The portions are HUGE; my daughter ate some of my noodles and I still had enough for myself PLUS leftovers. All the meats were good (not a fan of shrimp on sugarcane, I learned) and temps were perfect. Hot tea is complimentary; I also got a mango bubble tea (like a smoothie, I prefer milk-based normally but it was good).\n\nService was a little slow, but I think they expect you to flag them down when they're needed. They give you menus and a little notepad to write down what you want (menu #, how many etc.), but are very friendly when asked questions; for example, they bring a fish sauce mix with the food, which is slightly different than the straight sauce in the bottle on the table.\n\nI've had pho in a number of other locations (Raleigh, Boston etc.) and this was the best I've had. I like that it's close to Whitby. I asked if they did delivery; they are trying to get it set up, but they're pretty new, so it's not available yet.\n\nWe will definitely go back!

It can be hard to find so keep an eye out for the turn into the plaza.\n\nWe came here on a Thursday evening and it was PACKED! We had about a 15 minute wait before we were seated at our table and then we were able to dig right into the buffet. In my opinion, Imperial is just a poor substitute for Mandarin, if we're being honest. It's slightly cheaper and they offer coupons (everyone but us had a coupon) but they don't have nearly the same selection and the food just isn't as good.\n\nThat being said, we enjoyed a few plates of the hot buffet, which includes prime rib, lots of seafood including hot and cold shrimp, crab legs (I don't have them but they're very popular), all of the standard chinese fare, like chicken balls, chicken fried rice, sweet and sour pork, etc, and some american fare, like french fries, onion rings and pizza. I rarely get salad or soup at buffets but they had quite a selection here. The main thing to come to Imperial for is the dessert area. This area is the main sort of focus when you walk into the buffet room, they have all kinds of pies and squares, a fresh waffle station with toppings, an ice cream bar and a fruit bar. Good selection and everything was decent.\n\nThe service here is what's to be expected from a buffet. Our \"server\" came by once to get a drink order and then one of the busgirls was at our table more often than anyone else. I certainly hope she ended up getting a portion of the tip we left. \n\nOverall, the Imperial is a decent meal, if you have a coupon its probably a better reason to go but if you're in AJax, you may as well just drive the extra 10 minutes to Pickering and go to the Mandarin where you'll get more choice and better food and probably better service too.", "date": "2013-09-07 20:15:23"}

The restaurant was pretty much empty with the exception of 5 tables (a total of 15 guests max). We noticed that many of the empty tables had not been cleared. The wait staff walked by the waiting us, the waiting guests, several times and did not acknowledge our presence. While waiting, a couple came in and proceeded to seat themselves. In passing they told us that they were the owners. After hearing that, we were pretty sure we would be seated right away but instead the wait staff proceeded to clearing a table for the owners to sit. After waiting for another 5-10 minutes, it was evident that the wait staff had no intention of clearing the tables to seat us so we left, and so did the other waiting guests.

The tortillas that are supposed to be steamy hot and fresh, came to our table cold and sticking to each others. Its ridiciulously bad quality food for the amount we paid.

Every hour, there is a big lucky draw. There are a lot of people who use card to hold the spots or ones that as we are lining up, they play two machines.\n\nThe aisle between the machines are very narrow, so as you wait for the machines. People are always like \"excuse me\" \n\nThey will text you once table is ready. Usually it's an hour wait, so you will end up spending some money in the slots. \n\nOn Mondays, from 4pm-11:00pm, all you can eat ribs (winners circle reward for $14.99) if you don't have your winners circle reward card, the original price is at $19.99. For Thursday, prime rib and 2 lobster tails. For winners circle is $14.99 and non members regular price at $19.99.\n\nIf you forget your physical card, you just have to wait in a super long line up at the Winners Circhle to get the card again. \n\nFor the meal, you will have to wait after checking in at the restaurant, usually for an hour. During that hour you can play slots and free self served pop, coffee. The meal was worth the wait. Three courses for $14.99 with the member winners circle card. You get a salad, your own choice of dressing, such as ranch, Italian, balsamic etc. Then the main, two lobster tail and the prime rib. For dessert a carrot cake. Well worth the price and tasted pretty good. Service was a little slow due to the special. But overall nicely done!", "date": "2018-09-28 02:49:05"}

Now in addition to the Angus roast beef and pork loin you can have sausage,  pork pieces,  beef ribs,  zucchini,  sweet potatoe and pineapple. I might have missed something but look at the picture to see this smorgasbord! \n\nPersonally I avoid breaded and overly processed foods but like everyone else that's a personal choice so I can't comment on most of their other dishes.  However I see people going back for seconds of most things. With this in mind for dessert I recommend the creme brule.\n\nI love both their hot and cold crab legs.  But take this tip and only choose the brightly coloured ones.  The darker legs and claws taste OK,  but the meat does not come out willingly. \n\nSign up to their newsletter and you will almost always have a bogo coupon which combined with these new additions to the menu make it an affordable dinner for two. \n\nTo reach five stars I would have to point to the wait staff.  While most are attentive to clearing plates and refilling water, they should raise the bar and watch for other guest needs like extra napkins,  crab cracker tools or a quick wipe of a table between plates if the table needs it. \n\nFinally it might appear to be a trivial detail but the new salt and pepper shakers on the tables reassures me that they are always looking to improve. \n\nOtherwise it's always a pleasant experience.", "date": "2014-03-01 22:53:13"}

I loved my chicken pho soup, everything was fresh and yummy and the chicken pad Thai was also very tasty.  They just neglected to bring enough bowls and plates for our family to share. As well as tea cups. The portions are OK.  Not too big. We had to order an additional fried rice ( which wasnt very impressive, just average) because we were not full!

This is how the evening went:\n\n9:30 I get a call from some random person asking for Nicole and saying this is the number she had for her and telling me she was going to pick me up at some random address. Just an example of the disorganisation I witnessed that night.\n\n9:45 Bus arrives 45 minutes late and breaks down in front of our house, blocking all traffic in my neighbourhood for ~30 mins. Once we were on another bus that arrived shortly after, rather than continuing our night as planned, we were informed that we had to drive around to the other side of our bus until the driver could get it started. At that point the driver did not know how to hook up the jumper cables, so I had to go and hook them up for him. At 10:23 (fully an hour and 20 mins after promised pickup time- I know cause I checked my phone), we finally get back on the bus and begin to drive. At this point we have missed our reservation at our first stop as well as the additional members of our party that we were meeting there. \n\nI called Rex, the owner, to explain my displeasure and he informed me that he did not understand why I was upset but finally offered to give me $50 off of my cost (representing a whopping 7% savings), which I found completely outrageous considering the abysmal customer service I had received thus far.\n\nAt this point, being unable to come to an agreement we decided to get off the bus and continue our night using taxis. I am in the process of trying to get my deposit back via paypal resolution service. Wish me luck!\n\nAlso, it should be noted that the 'karaoke' that they mention having on the bus is a single dvd that plays a few 10 year old songs, out of a TV in the back of the bus.

We stopped by on a Saturday while doing some errands to have some poutine before we got our shopping done.\n\nI guess the head office is located right next door and this location has three counters, one for poutine, one for hot dogs and one for burritos, but only one counter is staffed at a time I guess. We checked out the menu and ended up ordering a Country Style for me and he got the Chicken Bacon Ranch poutine. \n\nSo first thing - to the head office, please fix your terrible menu boards. Just as we were reading through poutines trying to decide what to order, the whole thing goes black and then a whole pile of red flannel plaid shows up. Don't do that - I'm here to look at the menu, not your logo, which covers every other surface.\n\nIt wasn't long of a wait for our food and there was a small line by the time we got our meal and sat down. The first time I had smokes was years ago downtown and every time I've gone to the location on Dundas (I think) its been a fantastic poutine experience. This wasn't to be the case here.\n\nFirst of all - you're known for poutine. I want gravy, lots of it, and it needs to be HOT. If I wanted raw cheese curds on top of lukewarm fries then I'd order that. The whole point of a poutine is for the curds to get a little melty and stringy but still squeak against your teeth when you bite into it. Second of all, everything was lukewarm. The chicken wasn't hot, the bacon wasn't hot, the peas weren't hot, the fries weren't hot, the gravy wasn't hot.... and then, to my dismay, we see the people after us sit down with poutine containers that are STEAMING they're so hot. What gives???\n\nThe other thing I remember about smokes is their incredible gravy. The flavor jumped out of the box at you and this gravy was BOOOORINGGGGG. What happened to that lovely rosemary infused gravy I loved so much??\n\nVery sad, I had such high hopes for my visit here - will not return to this Smokes location.

We were seated after about 20 minutes, which was surprising as the entrance was full and we had no reservations. \n\n My requests of putting two tables together had 3 members of their staff orchestrating amidst a sea of hungry patrons, take note: some were not so impressed with our entourage bombarding in with a crew of staff speaking in their native tongue debating which table to give us.. \nOh dear, most diners who glared angrily seemed dateless, impatient and extra hungry because again... dateless and here for the love of stuffing your face until having a date in the first place would've hindered all possibilities of indulging, so coming here 'dateless' was beginning to bring meaning to 'single and loving it'. Cheers to my dateless yet happy foodies!!! \n\nOn the other hand, hubby and I took our nephews and nieces including our baby girl for a hearty treat to an AYCE to avoid catering to one's craving and instead this place fed our hungry warriors happily with an incredible selection of sushi, meat and lots of meat including ribs, steak and seafood cravings?! Shrimp galore (fried and fresh), oysters and clams, crab legs!! YAS! DESSERT wasn't even ready for this troupe.\n\nStaff was quick to clear our tables, more napkins here, another order of drinks there and every request answered with a smile despite the busy night we chose. \n\nIt's quite rare that a buffet makes good sushi, so I was blown away when hubby had me try their green dragon rolls and that was that! I made a beeline for the rolls myself and then 2 dozen of the oysters(fairly fresh, they only give 2 at a time so plenty of trips made) and racked on some chocolate covered strawberries and perfectly satisfied. \n\nAtmosphere is great, located in a fairly new modern plaza.

I of course got the house special pho and was impressed with the combination  of beef, and still rare steak. Nice touch. \n\nA mis step if I had to say there was one was that the noodles were the dry kind and were smushed in a small bowl then added to the pho. It was a little tough to mix and get at.

The reviews were fantastic, so we were in! It's in the corner of a plaza in an unlikely place for a restaurant; just when you think you've missed it, there it is. \n\nIt was packed. Completely packed. There was no one waiting when we got there, but there was soon after we were seated. We found a small table in the corner and snagged it. We had just gotten settled when our server told us a bigger table by the window was free. Perfect! Brownie points already and we haven't eaten anything! \n\nIt's a small place with a country feel; nothing fancy, but it doesn't need to be. The food speaks for itself. The prices are almost too reasonable. I don't think I've ever said that, but after eating there and having amazing service, you will also agree. \n\nI went with the Signature Pancakes with blueberries and my mom went with the special which is similar to the Spinach Delight but with ham and cheese. These pancakes were made with love. They were fluffy, moist and blue! I've never had pancakes quite like them. My mom's omelette was huge and they didn't hold back on the fried potatoes. It was literally bursting with toppings. The fried potatoes were to die for. If I wasn't so full of delicious pancakes, I would've stolen all of them! \n\nScrambles feels like home. Food made with love and servers that make you feel comfortable instantly. This is the type of restaurant I love going to.  \n\nGoing out for breakfast?

Especially since we had to wait 10-15 minutes for our food, which is quite a long wait for a \"fast\" food restaurant. \n\nI came here with a friend and I had the chicken peppercorn poutine with mushrooms in the \"traditional\" meal size which came out to $10.15 and my friend ordered the vegetarian rainbow for the same price. The customer service was good and they even have a counter with a variety of sauce options which is nice, but to me I would rather have something with more oomf.

I've been slowly changing my opinions of BP as the service has gotten much better in recent past!\n\nIt was well past lunchtime so the dining room wasn't all that busy and we were seated in a nice booth. Our server was rather nice, although I got the sense that she might be new because she didn't seem totally comfortable. Oh well. I did drop the hint that it was my friend's birthday but that there was to be no singing at her request. We ordered drinks and poked around the menu.\n\nWe ended up splitting an order of potato skins (my friend's favourite) and I ended up getting one of their healthier choice pizzas (Spicy Garlic Chicken Pizza). Now I'm not usually a fan of potato skins; they end up being kind of flavorless, have too much or not enough potato and someone always skimps on the toppings. These were pretty damned good. My friend asked for the BBQ sauce on the side (apparently they either go overboard or don't put any on) and that was a good call for sure. Not a menu item I would order but I will for sure get these again. \n\nMy pizza was delicious, I asked for multigrain crust but I don't think she put that in my order because it looked like the regular crust. No biggie because it tasted absolutely fantastical. It came out hot and the balance of flavors was pretty impressive. Sesame seeds, green onion, bbq chicken, peppers and a yummy sweet but spicy garlic sauce on it. Unfortunately when I had leftovers a day or two later, they didn't agree with me, so I won't be getting this pizza again (this has happened twice now) but it was great, so if you have a stomach that isn't bothered by a bit of spice you should be fine!\n\nAs requested, my friends' birthday dessert came out without fanfare and it was surprisingly large! Two brownies and two scoops of ice cream drizzled with chocolate and caramel. I had to help her and we couldn't finish it but I was impressed with the portion size (and man... those were some good brownies). \n\nOverall, pretty pleased with the service and the food quality was better than I've had at a BP in a long time. I think a good rule of thumb with BP is to stay away from most of the tomato based pastas  because they all taste like chef boyardee. It's a pizza place, get the pizza, go for the bar favourites like wings and potato skins and you shouldn't be disappointed!", "date": "2012-04-17 15:34:02"}

Never going back. We have been here quite a few times for late night drinks and snacks, but this was the last time! \nJust went in for a drink with the wife. They were fairly busy, and it seemed like there was only one bartender on. This was a Saturday night. We found a booth and waited about 7 mins for no service. I had to go to the bar to order my beer and a caesar (which as usual, didn't have any of the special garnishes it should) for the wife. We got the drinks shortly after that. Talked and enjoyed my drink for the next 10 mins. \nFinished my drink and chatted for about another 10 mins. I was about ready for another beer and at this point, looked over and noticed the bartender settling up with some customers. Luckily I caught eye contact with the bartender in the red football jersey with the name \"Montana\" on the back. Held my empty glass up and nodded to her, in hopes of getting another drink before last call. It was 1:34. \nAfter that I didn't get my beer and there was no contact at all for the next 5 minutes until my wife stopped one of the servers. She asked for my beer and the server looked confused and said she didn't know - that she was done her tables (we were clearly not one of her tables). She talked to the bartender and then came back and said they can't serve anymore alcohol because its after last call and that they are not allowed to tell people that it's last call. She said we had already asked for our bill, anyways! At no point did we ever talk to anybody to ask for our bill!!! \nSo now our original bartender came to our table and asked if everything was good and if we were ready for our bill. I asked if I could get another beer and she said we already called last call. We are not allowed to announce that we called last call (but why?!!). After more attitude she said she would see what she could do.  \nShe went back to the bar after about 3 min of waiting, we decided that it wasn't even worth it and we definitely wouldn't be back. \nI went back to the bar to settle up and asked the bartender if people normally have to order from the bartender when sitting at one of the booths. She said no, its just a busy night. \nIn conclusion, I will not come back to this Boston pizza because of the attitude and unprofessionalism of the staff and a clear lack of teamwork to top it off.", "date": "2013-01-13 08:22:12"}

Something I personally look for in a butter chicken is if the gravy is not sweet. A lot of restaurants serve it with a sweeter gravy, but thankfully this wasn't the case here. \n\nThe Reshami Kebab was ground Chicken based with a strong flavour of coriander. It was good, but a tad bit dry, but that may be because chicken doesn't have as much fat in it to seal in the flavour \n\nOverall, I had a pretty good experience and I might come back for the Seekh Kebab because it's a good option for takeout if you're in the area. \nI wouldn't recommend dining in here, as the service is VERY slow and the restaurant is often empty.

Ironically, they shorted the same dish 3 weeks later at my place. When I called to notify them they said it would be delivered in 30 minutes. Then they called to say they were sure I had it, but committed to 30 minute delivery. I called back an hour later and was told the manager was sure it was packed and they wouldn't be delivering it.

Came in Sunday at noon, well pass the rush. Table for 2. First thing I noticed was the wasp flying around our table and the amount of bread crumbs that were brushed up against the window. The server spilled my orange juice on the tray, so once it was on the table we had puddles of juice that she didn't wipe up throughout the entire meal. Eventually I checked to see if the cup was leaking...it got really messy. There are no napkins on the table, we used our straw wrappers to clean what we could. Also for $4 for juice, I would have liked a full glass. The food was sub-par at best. Scrabbled eggs so badly overcooked and very dry. You could get fresher scrambled eggs at a buffet. Over easy egg had a broke yolk that was cooked through completely and covered with potatoes, cook must have thought we wouldn't notice? Potatoes had pressure bruises and sprouts that were never removed before cooking, otherwise potatoes were dry and unseasoned. I don't know how to explain the corned beef hash, but there were white flakes that must have been potato of some sort, I don't know why it isn't mixed with their homefries, but you get the hash and a side of potatoes. Bacon was very fatty, not crispy and sitting in a puddle of grease on the plate. Sausage was typical grocery store brand and went untouched. 1 jam packet comes with your toast, which was actually just warm bread, not toasted and only partially buttered. The middle was soaked and the sides untouched. The juice and coffee were good. Server never did a quality check just asked if we were done. I was going to let her know of the problems and we desperately needed water but she just never came to us. We did get a good chuckle as a server asked the next table if they wanted hot sauce with their meal and for them to give an awkward response that french toast and hot sauce don't mix. Breakfast for 2 was $38 plus a tip. Far too expensive for poor diner food and bad service. We should have went to Symposium or Ajax's original Sunset Grill on Bayly.

I have my usual places while in the city to eat, but I wanted to try a place that I have never been to.\n\nI have visited this plaza for years. Best Buy and Old Navy were and still are my most frequented stores here. I knew about this Kelseys, but never went in there until yesterday.\n\nI got a decent parking spot close to the front door. I walked in and was immediately greeted by a host. She asked whether I wanted the dining room or bar. I normally go with the former. I saw the game on between the Flyers and Devils, and chose the latter instead.\n\nI got to choose my booth. Nice!\n\nOut of all the Kelseys that I have visited for the last 1.5 years, the staff here are the friendliest. They like one another and it shows.\n\nI got a wonderful server who got me my Diet Pepsi and asked if I needed any refills throughout my meal. I ordered my favourite, which is the original (ten) New York style wings in sea salt and black pepper. I got ranch dip for my celery and carrot sticks.\n\nAs usual, these wings are consistent no matter where you go. These were yummy. The man who brought my food asked if I wanted any additional dipping sauces for my wings. It was a nice touch.\n\nI would have given a perfect five stars. The problem is that I had ordered the takeaway cookie for dessert. Instead, I got the messy cookie sandwich. It is essentially double the number of chocolate chip cookies, except that they are heated up, and the whole dessert comes with vanilla ice cream, and chocolate and caramel sauces. Even though my order was wrong, this dessert looked so good that I went with it.\n\nThe verdict? This dessert worked for me. I didn't have all the chocolate sauce, as the cookies and ice cream were sweet enough. The scoop of vanilla ice cream was perfect for my needs. It was all yummy that I am glad that this mistake had panned out.\n\nThe women's washroom is clean and looks like it was recently renovated. Frankly, the entire restaurant looks like it had a makeover.\n\nThe bar area is cozy, especially when you are seated at a booth. I had a great time watching the hockey game. The Flyers won in dramatic style at the end of the third period.\n\nI'd come back here again, as it's a relaxed place to dine. It's nice that I can finally say that I have dined here.\n\n(374)", "date": "2018-10-21 22:29:17"}

Whatever it is...I hope he finds it in his hairy chest to treat paying customers with a bit more respect.", "date": "2015-10-02 02:22:41"}

Although this restaurant has plenty of locations within Toronto, not all of them served raw seafood  so since it was my sister in law's birthday, we decided to head east to Ajax and give it a try to see if it was worth the money.\n\nWe made reservations for a Sunday evening and got there right at 6pm.  They gave us our table and away we went.  I pretty much tried everything they had to offer, trying everything from prime ribs, to a couple of their salads, all their meats at their meat station, sushi, desserts and of course their seafood.\n\nTheir seafood station was manned by a girl who kept close tabs as to the number of seafood items one could take.  On that evening, each patron was only allowed to take 4 oysters and 2 scallops per trip so I took my fair share.  Then I scooped a pile of crab legs, some escargot, some shrimp and mussels at the other seafood station.  Looking at the oysters, I could tell they were rather large and looked like the creamy type.  I'm not too sure which type of oyster I had first (it was actually the non Cherrystone one) but one bite into the first oyster and it was like yikes!  The oyster was bad, really bad, so bad that I actually had to spit it out.  The oyster had a rotten taste to it.  Having woken up to my senses now, I was reluctant but went on and tried the second oyster.  That oyster, albeit better than the first one, was rather bland and tasteless.  I proceeded to the Cherrystone oysters and the scallops and they too were rather bland.  The problem I think was that when the waiters went to put ice on top of the raw seafood, the ice melted and it diluted or watered down the oyster to the point where the raw oyster with no condiments added to it had no flavor to it.  I was rather disappointed as it was my first meal there and that was my first impression of it all.\n\nWhat fared better were the crab legs.  There were plenty of hot and cold crab legs available and truthfully they were far better than the raw seafood.  The crab legs were very fresh and plenty of napkins and claw crackers was provided to assist with the opening of the legs.  The cold shrimp was quite fresh as well as they tasted as decent as they could be.\n\nThe rest of the food provided was average at best.  One could get a partial good taste of it but never the fulsome of it all.  For example, the roasted pork was freshly brought out however the crunchy skin part was very chewy and not crunchy at all.  The meats at the meat section had plenty of flavor in them as they were well seasoned however the prime rib was a little disappointing in that the server had a hard time find a medium rare piece for yours truly.  Most of the prime rib was medium or pretty close to being well done.  The sushi was a little cold and had either too much rice in them or not enough ingredients.  The sushi that had sprinkles of sesame in them actually tasted the best.  Even the leaves of the romaine salad lacked taste and the creamy Caesar sauce unfortunately was contaminated with French dressing which made the taste of the salad extra funky.  Many of the desserts tasted okay but lacked the true richness of it all.  This included the creme brulee, the honey sticks and the egg custard pie.\n\nBesides the crab legs, the only other decent meal of the night was the lobster and crab bisque.  There was some crab meat and some lobster meat in the soup and one could definitely taste the seafood in it.  The soup was rather creamy and tasted pretty good.\n\nOutside of the crab legs, the seafood was certainly disappointing.  Although the hosts were worried that people would be helping themselves to seconds and thirds, unfortunately one trip to the oysters and scallops station was plenty enough for me. I think throwing ice on top of the oysters and scallops was a big mistake.  It diluted the seafood and made it super bland.  The night was made somewhat worse when an individual behind us was coughing profusely for about an hour.  Needless to say, many people moved to another table or to another part of the restaurant.  That weekend evening it was $28.99 per person with seniors and kids getting a slight discount to it.  I have to admit I was disappointed at the quality of the seafood which was why we drove all the way out there in the first place.", "date": "2017-01-27 18:26:15"}

We were served by a woman who we suspected might be the owner. My Mom wanted a nice place to celebrate her daughter-in-law's birthday.  The daughter-in-law ordered mussels. My niece ordered the antipasta plate for one. The antipasta plate was unattractive and sort of looked like a child's plate made by a frugal mother. Extremely thin slices of meat and cheese slapped on a bare small plate with tiny little sides of black olives and another of artichokes.  Blah and pricey at maybe $14? The mussels served to my sister-in-law were small and not generously proportioned, perhaps about 16 mussels, perhaps costing about $15.  She ate one or two and my Mom ate one. Both of them agreed they weren't very good, in fact, maybe bad?  I tasted one as did my niece, we all agreed they tasted fishy, were more rubbery than usual and seemed cooked poorly too. None of us were comfortable eating them safely. (Oh and there was very little sauce/broth). No problem, we thought. Mistakes happen.  My Mom flagged down the woman who was serving us and told her. We said we all tried it and we all agreed it was fishy. The server argued with us, telling us, like we were born yesterday \"They are mussels, they are supposed to taste fishy\" My mother replied she'd \"eaten mussels all over the world and mussels don't usually taste fishy\" The server, lips very tight told us haughtily, the mussels are fresh. She took them away in anger and tossed them.  She had a very polite busboy and another server serve us for the rest of the meal, which was a relief for us.  My niece and I had already ordered the linguini alla pescatore so it was too late to change our mind away from seafood.  My niece called hers bland, mine was bland but salty. I ate half of mine because I was hungry but it was perhaps the worst linguini plate I can recall eating at a nice restaurant.  On a good note, My mother ordered veal picatta and it was excellent (although my Mom got some attitude when she asked if they had gluten free pasta). My sister-in-law ordered the special stuffed chicken with goat cheese and also loved hers. My Mom told the new younger red-headed server it was my sister-in-laws birthday and she got a little whipped cream with a candle in it. The birthday girl ordered a dessert for two, Zabaglioni perhaps and I am the only one who could eat it, my sisiter-in-law didn't see it had alcohol in it, my neice tried it and didn't like it, I thought it was lovely.  The woman was frosty as we left.  It cost my Mom about  $188.00 with tip ($28 tip) but no alcohol and a couple coffees. All four of us not only wouldn't recommend it but would warn people against it.", "date": "2016-07-14 21:05:44"}

Me being a female of Indian descent, I was very, very excited to try the food after reading the reviews on yelp. As soon as I walked in, the place was completely packed and it was burning, no a/c. I ordered two chicken buriyanis, one mild and the other spicy, and one mango lassi. I thought the chicken buriyani was $9.95 so I was like meh, yolo. It ended up being $10.95. They gave my sister a glass of water because she asked for it and an elderly lady gave her a bag of gummies. The service was great, thus the second star, but I am the definition of disappointment right now. I had to wait a good hour for the two buriyanis. The mango lassi came within ten minutes, (thank god) but it was $2.25 for a small cup. I come home excitedly to try my food and I started crying. Yes, crying. The food looked so disgusting and inedible, I felt like I let my sister down. The total was $25.27 because of the 10% cash discount, if not, it would have been $28.07. The food did not even cover half the takeout box and it was just yellow coloured rice with mushy curry. The spicy buriyani was not even spicy and the mild tastes disgusting. I am writing this review right after eating that food and I am already sick to my stomach. Please do not purchase the buriyanis if you go here. I have ate $4 buriyanis with the box overfilled and great taste. I wanted to like this place so bad, but I can't. I will not return here again.", "date": "2015-06-21 00:42:28"}

My fianc\u00e9e was the only one to order the pasta and that didn't come out for ages either, in fact they tried to give her steak on three separate occasions. \n\nI knew not to expect much from the food, but their kitchen even managed to disappoint my adjusted expectations. The jack Daniels steak was maybe 4oz of very tough chopped up poor quality beef (hardly a steak), poorly cooked and hard to cut and worst of all covered up with a ton of watered down BBQ sauce. Yep, bottled BBQ sauce on a small shitty cut of beef. Divine. \n\nTo make matters worse, They couldn't even execute a Caesar salad properly. The creamy, bottle dressing wasn't even mixed through and sat in clumps throughout. \n\nShit show. Top to bottom. \n\nI'm a fan of Symposium for desserts and coffee and maybe even the occasion breakfast, but what a train wreck for lunch/dinner.

Not too heavy and very tasty without being over the top. If you like spicy - just ask :) I normally stick to Medium myself. If you order flaming potatoes I'd recommend going with Mild unless you can handle the heat! :)\n\nI'd definitely recommend ordering from the menu vs the buffet. The buffet is perfectly fine, but it's a buffet! :) and I prefer to order my favourites. Some of my favourites are the flaming potatoes, spinach paneer, pakoras,  haandi chicken, (they also do a sizzling chicken plate that I've never personally tried but it looks, smells and sounds amazing!). Their Kulfi (Ice Cream) dessert is also very good! \n\nThey're all about a friendly atmosphere, and great food. Manohar (the owner) often takes the time to speak to diners; asking them how the food was and he also has a lot of interesting stories to tell once you get to know him :)\n\nThere's parking at the back of the restaurant that you can access via Church St. In another review I can see someone's had difficulty finding it. I can see why that would be the case :) It's just one of those things about dining in Pickering Village. Narrower streets with little nooks here and there :)\n\nRestaurant is often busy, even on a Tuesday night!

Mostly take-out but they do have a few tables to eat in if you'd prefer. Our order consisted of a large pizza and an order of lasagna. Our order was ready fairly quick and we returned home hungrily and ready to dig in: First,  the pizza: We ordered a large meat lovers pizza which consisted of pepperoni, sausage, ground beef and ham.  The pizza was cooked well however,  wasn't as flavourful as we hoped.  The crust is more of a 'bread\" style crust,  not really crispy as we prefer.  Overall,  I would say it wasn't horrible, but nothing to write home about either. Perhaps a step up from a frozen grocery store pizza.  On to the lasagna:  In short,  it was horrible.  Soggy, gummy noodles, sauce that tasted like a cross between tomato paste and ketchup, rubbery cheese and a burnt bottom.  My toddler who lives on pasta of any kind woulden't even eat it after the first bite. Overall this place satisfied my curiosoty however,  we will not be returning.

They are an all you can eat Japanese-ish place that uses iPad ordering.  The decor is rather weird for an Asian restaurant of any type with lots of purple and silver and crystals handing from the ceiling, making it look more like a bar or disco than a restaurant.  They were placing rap, hip-hip, and R&B which added to the \"where is the dance floor?\" feel,  We arrived at 8:45pm and they close at 10pm, but the first thing the server said is to make sure and order right away as they would be cutting off service soon.  This was not an auspicious start to the evening and the fact only 2 other people were in there eating raised a red flag.  \n\nA look over the menu showed was not encouraging as the variety was distinctly lacking for this kind of place and they were quite heavy on the Chinese style dishes.  We started with miso soup which was not as good as the instant mix kind I usually buy at the local Asian grocery.  The tempura was probably the best thing they had since that has to be made fresh while most of the other stuff we got was obviously boxed frozen food (coconut shrimp, cheese won-tons, fried scallops, and dumplings especially).  The pork katsu was very thin and very overcooked and probably a frozen cutlet.  The teriyaki was not too bad and the beef skewers were actually pretty good.  The beef fried rice was awful, very dry and desperately in need of salt and the beef was so thinly shaved it reminded my husband of phily cheese steak meat.\n\nThe sushi was mediocre at best and the wasabi was so weak you could eat it straight and still feel no heat.  The sashimi was tiny very thin pieces and they only had 4 kinds of fish.   The nigiri were OK and had a bit more meat on them but the lame wasabi kind of ruined the esperience.  I got a tempura shrimp roll which was OK but no as good as at other places I have eaten.\n\nDessert was supposed to be on a lame salad/dessert bar but the staff had it cleaned off before 9:30 so all that was left was the ice cream when we were ready to try it.  Even the cookies had been put away!  We did manage to snag the last 2 mango yogurts (more like mango jello)  when we saw them start cleaning it away and they were OK but nothing I would really want again.  The ice cream was awful.  Bad quality green tea, strawberry, mango, and vanilla in 5 gallon tubs.  The taste was off on all 3 we tried (skipped vanilla) and very icy in texture.  (Note:  The salad/dessert bar photo on Yelp is nothing like what they had this night.  They had maybe 20% of what is shown in that photo.)\n\nBy 9:30 not only had they cleared away the dessert bar, but they started mopping the floors and trying to rush us out the door even though they didn't close until 10pm!  Not a very pleasant dining experience what with being rushed and the poor quality of the food.  We agreed that we will never go back.\n\nOverall, I would say this place has very little chance of staying in business for very long unless they clean up their act.  Maybe they are better if you show up early in the evening, but still the food was not good and so much was obviously frozen food service stuff and I can cook that myself at home for much less than $22 per person.", "date": "2014-02-07 19:44:03"}

However, these guys have NO idea how to run a sports bar when there are major sports events going on. \nLast year we were there for the Stanley Cup final. They had the Jays on the big screen, and NO hockey game at all on the other small TV's. Our waitress understood and tried to get the mgr to change the TV. She was told that 2 guys asked for the Jays on the big screen. We were 8, and we asked the guys around us and all wanted hockey. The mgr refused. We were about to leave when the owner showed up and changed the big screen. He seemed upset about it, but still his mgr had no clue how to deal with this.\nWe were there May 10 for the Leafs big game. This time, they tuned EVERY TV in the place to the game. That was fine, but there were two other playoff games and a Jays game going on. We asked the waitress why some of the small TV's couldn't have the other games and she said she'd talk to the mgr. It wasn't until the second period started that the Rangers game came on a few TV's. Shortly after the Jays came on some other TV's. Never did see the Red Wings game on any of the TV's. So again, with all the options they have to show all the big events going on, they had no idea how to deal with it. \nI give it two stars since the waitresses have all been pretty good. Food is very average and they don't really seem to care. I won't be going back.", "date": "2013-05-12 13:33:21"}

She burned my legs on the first day (no consultation). The owner promised me it wouldn't happen again & that they had someone else who was from a clinic so after the 2 months it took for my legs to heal (I had to buy for all the polysporin to help with the healing) I went back, because I thought I trusted them. I had 3 more sessions with the girl from the laser clinic and everything was good (not a significant difference but also no burns). Then I went in for my 5th treatment and I had the owner again. The other lady had quit the spa and the owner had been doing a lot of the other customers so I thought maybe she had gotten better and no longer needed this other girl or something. Was I ever wrong. She burnt my legs yet again. I went in to ask for my money back and she gave me a quarter of my money back. Then I had to fight for at least half, which was a struggle.

No issues with hair, plastic or anything else in my food. \n\nBeen ordering for the last 1.5- 2 years, food is still consistent. I'm originally from the states, and there's certain Americanized Chinese food staples there - crab Rangoon is one of them and served at every Thai and Chinese restaurant. Thai crab Rangoon tastes much different than the Chinese version but they still have it\n\nI found this restaurant originally due to them serving crab Rangoon's - essentially cream cheese, very small portion of imitation crab, green onions deep fried in wonton. Not many Chinese places have it here, except Panda Express and 2-3 random locations all over GTA. This is one of the better crab Rangoon's served in GTA. I still find several of their dishes are delicious, besides the Rangoon's. Not sure why the reviews are off, but if you're craving Chinese that's fried and a bit greasy,  without going downtown, this is it. And the staff is very receptive to changing and asking for certain things - I.e, less sauce, more sauce, etc.\n\nI'd recommend - \nwonton soup - it's fresh, has the proper amount of veggies, generous dumplings and if you try the 'house wonton' it comes with actual shrimp and chicken with the veggies and wontons. It is salty, but that's standard Americanized wonton soup!\n\nCrab Rangoon's - one of the few places around that has. These are absolutely great. They're a little of the sweet side of a typical crab Rangoon, Try them! \n\nDumpling - they do them right here. They're large and filled with meat/veggie filling. I prefer mine steamed but I've had the pan fried. Both are delicious and the homemade sauce they give is so tasty. \n\nSweet and sour chicken - deep fried chicken fingers that you can dip in the standard sweet and sour sauce or with plum sauce. I find most of the time they get these moist. I've had a few one offs from them where they're dry/overcooked, but 95% they deliver moist.\n\nGeneral tsos/sesame chicken/orange chicken/orange beef- I think all of these are great, however these are drowned in sauce - I've asked for less sauce in past or sauce on the side and they've done this to a 'T'. \n\nBoneless sparerib - good, but a bit saucy.

I'd never been here before and was invited to a work Christmas party.\n\nThis venue is actually surprisingly nice - I had no expectations walking in and it has a very nice large clean main hallway. There was another party going on in another ballroom but you wouldn't have known it. No excessive noise or piles of people milling about. There was an area just outside the ballroom where people could mingle with cocktails but it was far too small for a party of about 100. The bar here was also far too small and the venue only had one bartender on at the beginning of the night, when there should have been two.\n\nThe main space was quite nice - very high ceilings, nice table linens/decorations. I felt that the window decor was a bit dated (and would be difficult to match if you had a color scheme, like for your wedding) but all in a very nice venue.\n\nWe had a salad to start, which was quite good, followed by chicken and beef with potatoes. The beef was nicely done (although some people didn't like it medium) and my boyfriend ate both our portions, and the chicken was good as well. Nice selection of veggies on the side. All in, a nice main course with some variety. The dessert was quite good, some kind of mousse but it was very tasty, although almost no one ate it as dessert was served too long after dinner. Most people had gotten up to mill around and the music had come on.\n \nOverall, I think that this is a very nice event/wedding venue. It's oddly located but with the hotel just across the way, it would be a good place for an event where drinking is encouraged. Very modern, not too dated and most likely affordable. The service was fairly good, but I did have to ask one of the servers to tell the staff that the bathrooms needed to be cleaned because the women's room was in very bad shape.", "date": "2012-12-12 16:36:54"}

It was delicious!! This was my first time, and I will definitely go back.\n\nWe started with the 'Onion Bhajia' - basically onion pekoras - tasty, light, not too greasy. They came with spicy, and tamarind dipping sauces. For the main course I had 'Subjee Naurangabadai' which was a \"flamed\" potato dish in a creamy sauce. The sauce was awesome! It didn't really taste like a traditional Indian curry, and you could really taste the \"flame\" in the veggies. The chef/owner(?) said it's a secret family recipe. My husband ordered Chicken Vindaloo. He said it was really good, very saucy and spicy (I didn't try, as I don't eat meat). We also had a side of Pillau Rice (seasoned with spices and onion - yummy!) and an order of Garlic Naan that was OUT OF THIS WORLD.  Someone complained in an earlier review that the naan was more like flatbread. It's true, it is a bit different (flatter) than other naan I've had, but that was okay because the flavour was great, and it was really airy and fresh tasting.\n\nThere are a LOT of vegetarian options, which was a treat (especially in Durham!). Mount Everest also serves three different Indian beers, with Cheetah on tap at a reasonable price ($4.95/pint), so you can have authentic beverages with your meal. The servers were very friendly too. \n\nNext time I will try the buffet. My husband said it is really good (but a la carte is even better). He recommends the lentils (apparently he went back for three portions from the buffet!).\n\np.s.

I ate here quite a while back but it was a memorable experience as I'd never had Indian Food before (and had never really been interested to. The person I was with was rather seasoned with different cuisines and had eaten at The Mount Everest many times, so they made a few recommendations and I got to try a few things I normally wouldn't have otherwise. \n\nWe came in on a weeknight and it was rather busy - luckily my companion had made a reservation! This restaurant is terribly small so if you're planning on popping in, you may want to call ahead and make a reso just to make sure you can get seated right away. \n\nI'm the kind of person that likes to know what I want BEFORE I go somewhere, so I'd spent some time looking over the daunting menu and trying to figure out what I was game for. In the end, we ended up getting an appetizer platter, naan, Mattar Paneer, and some kind of Biriyani.\n\nOne of the standouts was the Assorted Indian Snacks platter that we had to share. Having never had indian food, it was a great way to start the meal, with samosas, pakora, chicken tikka, papadum, sheekh kebab and some sauces. Given, I couldn't tell you which thing was which (besides the samosas) for sure but it was all incredible! What I THINK was the Pakora was amazing, great flavor, lots of heat - I kept taking them off the plate before the other person could get at them. This platter was surprisingly large and I was almost full after having my half. \n\nThe naan was incredible, just amazing - but you really have to eat it right away as it gets hard rather quickly. Fresh out of the oven naan was incredible, hot, buttery, soft and almost melt in your mouth. I would go back JUST for the naan because it was so damned good.\n\nMy Mattar Paneer was a bit of a letdown - I had been looking forward to trying Paneer for sooooo long. I love cheese and its been a staple in my house since I was a kid, and I've seen it made and it looked incredible, especially paired with peas (who DOESN'T like peas?!) but it really wasn't the dish for me. Flavor was a bit lacking and sadly, the paneer was disappointing, but I think that would have been true with any paneer dish - I had it quite built up in my head. The biriyani wasn't anything terribly memorable, but I only had a taste or two and its not something I would typically order myself anyways.\n\nAll in, this was a great local place to try out Indian food and I would go back again (but with someone who's adventurous into trying new foods). The menu is absolutely massive and it would take forever to try everything but I guarantee there's some serious gems hidden in the three pages of food. I'll be back (hopefully soon) to try it out again!", "date": "2012-08-02 14:57:54"}

Mostly because I find a lot of places, who tend to Americanize their foods, or over charge for really cheaply made dishes to be lacking. However, I do often go out to try them, if jus to give them a try.\n\nI went here with my mom, and we had their buffet.\n\nThe service was actually very good, they were very attentive and brought bread and water quickly. The owners seemed a bit overtly interested in talking with some guy on one side of the restaurant, but the rest of their staff was pretty good.\n\nThe atmosphere was interesting, it is picking and the place was a little small. However, it seemed like they really made an effort with the decorations, and the way everything was setup. The tables were a little awkward, and when you had the buffet you tended to be looming right over someones head.\n\nThe food was a mixed bag though. There were not very many options on the buffet, the options they did have were mostly meat. Also in their dishes with sauce it's like nobody really checked to see if anything was there. Looking for paneer in the Paneer Makhani was like hunting for treasure, the goat had little goat in it. The aloo gobi was absolutely appalling, it wasn't really cooked and wasn't flavoured at all. The yogurt had what tasted like sugar in it, the tandoori chicken was good, but when it ran out nobody replaced it. The naan were good, I liked how they were the right texture and everything. The dhaal was flavourless, and I'm not sure it was cooked quite right. The gulab jamun was fine.\n\nI will give them bonus points for having really good beer, i definitely like the fact that a small restaurant has Hop City Beer, that's a great brewery. So bonus point for that. Overall most things were good, but the buffet overall was definitely a fail.

Just keep coffee at one price and avoid the confusion. \nLocation was clean and nicely decorated, however, staff needs to be fully trained on all aspects of restaurant procedures and pricing.

All I remember is that it was beside what I believe was a hockey arena. \n\nTiny, but very clean place. The owner and I'm assuming his wife were incredibly nice and very helpful. What got me sold on this place were the juices. \n\nI've been to a lot of vape stores, and just like every other vape store out there they make their own in house ejuice. But Moonshine's ejuice, man oh man. Absolutely top notch! Some in house ejuices are poor and mediocre at best, but Moonshine's own brew of ejuice really shines.\n\nThey don't exactly have the biggest device/hardware selection on display, but when you try the juices you'll forget all about it. Which I'm guessing Moonshine's goal was, to really glorify their ejuices.\n\nIf you're looking for a great budget ejuice, I highly recommend Moonshine Brew. The prices are unbeatable for the sizes, and the juices themselves are customizable from VG, flavour shots, nicotine etc. \n\nEven if you are not from the area (as i wasnt) believe me, you'll want to add at least one Moonshine Brew ejuice to your collection, it's totally worth the drive. I couldn't believe the price I was paying for nearly premium tasting ejuice. It feels like a steal. And to add, they've got the closest clone to ANML's Looper that I've come by. Looper is really a hit and miss with clones.\n\nThe one thing that's got me down though is they don't have a peanut butter flavoured juice. Since peanut butter is usually my main vape, but fingers crossed they create a super tasty peanut butter concoction. \n\nI will absolutely come by to visit again!", "date": "2016-02-14 04:06:44"}

The selection in the buffet is not quite as big as some other buffets I have been too, but the food that is available is done right! I much prefer their philosophy of high quality over quantity when it comes to their food selections. There is about 6 to 8 types of curry/meat dishes, naan, rice, salad and sweet bread balls for dessert. All done deliciously.\n\nThe number one food item that stands out here is their Butter Chicken. I have had Butter Chicken in so many different restaurants, and hands down, the Butter Chicken in this restaurant is the best I have ever tasted in my life!!! It's not even close... if Mr. Singh's Butter Chicken finishes the race in 1st place, the 2nd place Butter Chicken is 10 miles behind. \n\nThe Butter Chicken at Mount Everest has such an intricate flavor with a touch of sweetness that really makes it shine. I can't describe it well enough, you just have to go there and taste it for yourself.

I tried the following flavors: red velvet, mocha, and vanilla. The presentation of each cupcake was lovely- each cupcake was topped rather nicely with some sort of sprinklings/topping, fondant cut out, or holiday message. The taste and texture was a disappointment though. Each cupcake I had was very dense and a little dry- almost similar to a muffin. I expect cupcakes to be a little more \"cake-y\". There wasn't a good balance between icing and cake because I found the icing was too sweet for me. I had to scrape it off but the \"cake\" itself wasn't any better because of the dryness and the muffin like texture. It seemed like maybe they were overcompensating with a super rich and extra sweet icing? The red velvet did not taste like the traditional red velvet cupcake- it lacked the familiar cocoa flavor I always taste when I bite into one & even seemed as though it was just a vanilla base dyed red?

The portions were so small compared to all the other restaurants I order from. It came in a container that I usually see for a side of rice. The thing that disappointed me the most was the flavour. There were no spices and no fragrance. The chicken itself was juicy and tender but the korma was weird and lumpy and tasted nothing like any korma I have eaten. I had ordered a garlic naan too. The naan was large but it did not taste like garlic naan. There was a few pieces of garlic sprinkled throughout, but again it lacked flavour. The only thing that sort of saved it was the Assorted Indian Snacks which consisted of a samosa, seekh kebab, chicken tikka and pakora. Everything there seemed to be seasoned well. The pakora was well spiced and fried nicely.

I was in need of some ingredients for brownies and some fruit for a staff meeting snack and this was on my way to my destination so I stopped in on a Thursday night around 8:30. This location isn't often crazy busy, at least not when I've been here. Perhaps because this store is well laid out and the aisles are spacious so you don't feel like you're tripping over other people. The produce is normally pretty good, although its laid out weird in the store. I came in looking for strawberries and had to walk around twice before I saw them in the cooler area. The bakery aisle is limited, which is unfortunate, but they had the semi-sweet chocolate I needed and it was at a really really good price to boot.\n\nThe service here is lacking. Most of the staff don't seem much to care and aren't overly pleasant but no one has been rude or standoffish enough to affect my general shopping experience. \n\nOverall, its a Sobeys, and its exactly what I'd expect a Sobeys to be. Word of caution - you NEED to know your prices if you're going to shop at Sobeys otherwise you'll waste a lot of money. Some stuff is well priced and some stuff is grossly overpriced, even when its on sale. A note about this location, the meat section is great here, they often have good prices and markdowns that make sense if you freeze meat. The dairy section is FANTASTIC - they carry stuff that no other stores in the area carry, like Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche (impossible to find at the time I was looking) and a lot of organic dairy produce. The freezer section has everything you could ever want and more too!", "date": "2013-03-20 16:13:49"}

After reading the Yelp reviews for Sauter's Inn we decided to try their breakfast menu. Big mistake.\n\nI ordered Eggs Benedict. This dish is the measure of any good breakfast cook/kitchen and when done right you can usually trust everything else on the breakfast menu to be palatable. I was served overcooked yolks! I asked the server to send it back to the kitchen and she did so with a puzzled look on her face. Apparently no customer has ever complained about ruined Eggs Benedict before. A short while later a new plate returned to my table. This time the egg yolks were done right but the English muffin beneath seems to have only been given a remote glance of the kitchen's toaster. The home fires were beyond disgusting. Home fires should have more flavor than just the grease from the deep fryer. The Hollandaise sauce was also bland and flavorless. In summary, this has to be the worst Eggs Benedict I have ever been served. I also have to mention the tepid barley drinkable Coffee. Free refills only make it worse.\n\nI don't fault the staff for the terrible food. I blame the business owners.

I asked the person who took my order about salad and she said the mixed vegetables doesn't come with salad, only the meat dinners come with salad. She said she could give me more rice. What they had provided was already probably 3 servings of rice. I noted that I specifically asked for salad when I ordered, and therefore was not interested in more rice. She did nothing to make it better which was disappointing. \nThe hot sauce they serve is great, like a pickled spicy condiment. The (abundant) rice was tasty, and the curried veg was satisfactory, not something I would return for. I really just wanted some salad. lol \n\nIf the owner reads this I would make the following recommendations: \n- more clarity on the menu to what constitutes a \"dinner\", perhaps more training for employees about customer service \n- tell the girls up front to chat less, and pay attending to making customers happy their priority. There was me and another couple in the restaurant. When their food came up, instead of bringing it to their table they just yelled out the number. If I can tell who's food it is, the people working the counter should go the extra 5 steps and just bring over their food\n- when a staff coughs or sneezes into their sleeve, they should still go wash their hands instead of continuing what they're doing \n\nOverall, I would give this place another try and be VERY clear about what I want and what I'm getting.", "date": "2018-02-04 22:58:22"}

Even with fresh ground pepper and grated parmesan cheese - a lot of both - the dish was still very bland.

Butterfish usually melts in my mouth and here, I couldn't be bothered to finish the pieces that were on the plate because the texture was kind of gross. All in, it wasn't a very good plate. The green salad was yum, but that's usually the standard at Japanese restaurants. The miso soup left something to be desired, probably the blandest miso soup I've ever had. \n\nThe thai dish that my friend ordered looked fantastic and the portion was massive.

The owner, Nick, while crazy busy, is a nice guy and most of the stylists etc are very nice. I will say that you shouldn't go here to get your hair done if you have somewhere else to be within the next few hours. Expect a solid chunk of time to be taken up while here. No one can dispute Nick's fantastic styling abilities. It's not cheap to get your hair done here but the cuts are FANTASTIC. It's my understanding that Nick studied hair design in Europe and it definitely shows. Even when your hair is growing out waiting for that next cut, it still looks fantastic. And even when I stopped going there, my hair still looked fantastic until the next time I got my hair cut elsewhere.\n\nI was usually going in for color and cut (sometimes with highlights) and the cheapest bill was probably in the area of $120. Until I had that terrible experience, I would have rated the salon a 4, but if you're looking for a good place to  have your hair done, this is one of the better places I've found.", "date": "2011-06-06 18:58:00"}

My mother has been going here for about 6 months now and she eats the (I believe it's called) French bread every day with her breakfast.

I'm fine with the price increase, however, a few days ago, my mother made her routine stop at Choko-Mocko to pick up her $10.50 loaf of bread.

The female owner asked her if she wanted a bag and my mother said no and that she would be okay.  Mind you, my mother lives right across the street from this plaza (I'd say not even 30ft) and when she left, the bread bag broke at the seam and her bread fell out on the ground onto the road.  She went back into the store to let the owner know, thinking hopefully the owner would replace the dirty bread she just paid $10.50 for (good customer service).  However, this did not happen.  Instead, the owner told my mother how it was her fault and that no one holds bread by the bag. She said originally asked if she had wanted a bag prior to leaving.  That's fine.

Before when there was no cover it was this way but it really turned out annoying when you would come on a Saturday and the place was dead but you were paying cover to get in, I could understand this just not in Ajax.\n\nThey used to always have the downstairs open and pool used to be free (with drink or food purchase) Tuesday - Thursday 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM and free all day on Sunday after 5:00 PM - The problem with this was it seemed that only 25% of the staff actually knew about it. I can't tell you how many times the person behind the bar would argue with me that they have never heard of free pool only to go upstairs and have to come down and apologize. If it happened once or twice it would have been more understandable but it honestly happened 5-6 times. \n\nThe final straw for me and Safari was the complete lack of consistency of the downstairs being open it became completely hit or miss whether it would open and was a waste of the gas to find out of we could play pool.

I'm not exactly sure how much it is for lunch, but I recall seeing a sign that it was around $15 for all you can eat. It sounds pretty expensive, cause I mean, you COULD go for sushi for this price, which is actually very true, but I don't think you could get freshly made deep fried lobster with great sauce and however much lobster you want for that price.\n\nI usually go to Congee Queen or other restaurants to pay $20+ for a lobster yee mein, and here, the staff were super friendly and even brought it to our table, or if there weren't any outside (as business was a little slow), said that we could just order it and they would bring it to our table. The plates were all promptly changed, and we had drinks almost immediately, whenever we ordered. There was no surcharge for any soft drink. This place is still relatively new, so I totally understand if they were trying to make a good impression on their customers. \n\nThe sushi didn't quite appeal to me, nor did any of the cold mussels, crab legs, shrimp and clams. I DID, however appreciate the mussels that were stir fried in black bean sauce. The food wasn't super hot, but the lobster was definitely really good. I also enjoyed how they made the peking duck on a trolley and served it to the tables. I would go out to dim sum restaurants and pay $160 for a peking duck lobster meal and find that the peking duck doesn't have meat on it or isn't cooked properly. The peking duck here, is actually cooked properly - (a little longer than needed though, so it's not as juicy) and it has meat in it. I didn't have to add anything myself and it was all handmade (that's why the skin of the peking duck wrap is a little different). \n\nFor a Chinese buffet, I felt like it was edible as a Chinese person. Many of the Chinese buffets like Mandarin taste terrible to me. I would say, that it is buffet standard food, so don't expect it to be like those sit-down restaurants with amazing quality (the only thing amazing was really the lobster, and the black bean clams when it is freshly brought out). I could tell that it's hard to make the food super hot all the time as it's still a relatively new place, but I think the staff are really trying to listen to their customers and make it a good experience. Secondly, for all you can eat lobster and for a free meal to the birthday person, I definitely had a good and non expensive experience here. (No automated tip charge).", "date": "2018-03-10 03:31:01"}

This review is a mashup of two separate experiences.\n\nThe first:\nWe went for lunch ayce on a weekday ($13.99). For the price, the food is pretty good. The fish was fresh. The rice was soft. The hot foods were pretty good. The deep fried scallops were one of the best I've had at ayce (most of the time, it's almost all breading. Here, it was almost all scallop). The tempura was crispy. The crystal roll and the kingston roll were fresh and delightful (think Vietnamese cold wraps with sushi roll inspired fillings). The deep fried milk was not so great, but all in all, I wouldn't begrudge this place a four star for this review. Why not a fifth star? Well, we had a bit of a mishap. Our waitress placed a plate of tempura broccoli and mushrooms on our table. I didn't recall ordering it, but I remembered considering it, so I assumed it was ours, and grabbed a mushroom. Our waitress then came back and took the plate away, saying it wasn't ours. I let her know that I had already taken a piece of it. She said that was fine, and whisked it away, giving it to a table about three booths down from us. Yeah. I ate from a plate that she gave to her other customers. She was fine with it. We were so shocked that we kinda laughed it off...\n\nThe second:\nWe made a reservation for about 50 for a Saturday at around 2pm ($14.99). Their party room seats are all torn up. What I mean is that the upholstery was not just cracked but the glossy exterior was entirely missing in large chunks. It was quite unpleasant, especially because our party was there to eat our post-funeral meal for my grandmother. The food was almost as good as our first visit, except that on the red dragon rolls, there was considerably less salmon sashimi (think about two centimeters of sashimi on each roll, instead of the entire top section of the roll being draped in sashimi). The orders, however, were continually incorrect, or missing, or going to the wrong tables. Tables got rounds and rounds of food before we got any. When we got some, there were cheaper rolls (california or cucumber or mushroom) placed with our red and green dragons when we didn't order them. We got imitation crab tempura instead of calamari. We got considerably less shrimp tempura than we ordered. Not cool. Our reservation was not during peak lunch hours, and we had informed them ahead of time. They did not provide us with enough servers or service to do this reservation justice. \n\nWould I come again? Probably if I was in a smaller group and it was a weekday. Would I come with a large group? Definitely not.", "date": "2015-07-01 22:29:46"}

Anyways you guys lost a loyal customer - I am never going back there ever!!!!", "date": "2016-08-01 15:00:37"}

We're pretty easy going people so my wife told them when they finally came by with the bill that the tuna didn't taste fresh. The waiter was rude, tried to tell us we were wrong, asked if we wanted new Tuna - we said we were full and maybe earlier in the meal we would have taken a replacement. He seemed really inconvenienced by us and eventually said he would ask his manager about taking those rolls off. He came back and said there was nothing wrong with the tuna and maybe we just didn't like tuna.....we have tuna rolls quite frequently and these tasted gross. He then offered desert instead which we said no to. The bill came with the tuna rolls still charged on it. Honestly I don't care about 5 dollars - but we won't go back. Odine may have saved a couple bucks by not discounting it, but they lost some customers. I would avoid. If you want good Thai go to i-Thai in Whitby, or for sushi go to makimono in Ajax.

Debbie's is nothing short of homely and sentimental. From the deco to the service, you'll feel like you're sitting in a friend's kitchen. Located in downtown Ajax in a shanty plaza, Debbie's is a local favorite.\n\nThe bad: one late evening I came in craving a slice of cake. Ordered carrot cake. Believe it was made in-house. Sat all pretty but when I tried to fork a piece to eat... both the cake and icing was crumbly. Absolutely no adhesion, thus I fashioned an awkward collection of chunks and crumbs on my fork. If this wasn't enough, it was 3/4 icing and 1/4 cake. The icing was hard and cold. Their fridge must have been on blast. To top it off, the carrot cake itself tasted nothing like carrot but completely like over spiced bread. I couldn't even pretend to like it. I ate a quarter and disposed the rest... and I never toss food. Other than that it is a very dark restaurant. Could use better lighting into the evening.\n\nThe good: breakfast here is like small ray of sunshine in the morning. Tea selection is spectacular. Right for you if you're a plain \"earl grey\" on some days, but a \"cream of earl grey\" on others like tea-keener me. I like the freshness of the some of the food I've had such as sandwiches, soups, and wraps and seeing it prepped in front of you.\n\nAs much as I want to want to redeem my negative experience, sadly I haven't visited since that careless slice of carrot cake.

One of the biggest factors was because the place isn't busy enough. There aren't enough people to eat the food so the food just ends up sitting there for a while. For example, the ribs were super tough and a bit cold.\n\nThe restaraunt had a decent selection of food, but most of it sucked. The deserts were absolutely disgusting. I couldn't finish any of the deserts besides a basic maroon. I ended up eating the general tso chicken and the lemon chicken. The chicken pieces were over cooked but the sauce was good.\n\nThey had a separate grill where they would cook beef short ribs, roast beef, and some vegetables for you. The issue was that the cook himself didn't know what he was doing. I asked for a medium roast beef and he gave me a well done piece. I then asked for a rare piece and he gave me a blue piece. I didn't like the marinade of the beef short ribs either. The pineapple covered in cinnamon was good, I just wish it was cut up in smaller slices though.\n\nOne item that did taste great was the Peking duck.. Not sure if it was an everyday dish or a grand opening special.\n\nI don't necessarily regret my visit, but there are much better options available.

That being said I was skeptical how delicious these items could really be...\n\nI came in on a Saturday afternoon and was pretty shocked to see that the bakery was vacant. The bakery is split into two areas - one half has a few shelves of health food items then in the centre is the bakery showcase / order desk and the far right side is a dine area with cafeteria style seating.\n\nThe lady behind the case was really helpful in describing what all the desserts were as nothing had labels or descriptions or even prices displayed.\n\nHere is a run down of I choose:\n\nNanaimo Bars - One of my favourite desserts, I was shocked to see that they had these here. Tastewise these were really good pretty close to the real thing, nice chocolate coconut base, creamy \"custard\" filling, and chocolately glaze on top.\nDate Square - Also great no complaints, gooey date filling crumbly oat crust.\nBlueberry Lemon Mini Loaf- Definitely could not tell this was gluten free as the texture was perfect. I adored the taste combination of sweet blueberries mixed into a lemon batter loaf with a crunchy lemon glaze on top.\nTwix bar - The shortbread crust was definitely not as good as the real thing probably because it was lacking that buttery richness, the caramel filling was a bit on the bland side and missing that deep rich flavour, and the use of a dark chocolate topping instead of a milk chocolate added bitterness to the bar that did not work. \nCarrot Cake - The texture of the carrot cake was a bit too crumbly and not holding together well, the \"cream cheese\" icing was more on the sweet side and missing that tanginess that I adore in cream cheese icing. \nChocolate Coconut Roll - Very dense, nothing spectacular but good if you like chocolate and coconut, simply semisweet chocolate and sweetened coconut rolled together\n\nOverall I have to say the desserts were hit and miss but it was really nice to see that a bakery like this is out in the East End for people with dietary restrictions.\n\nMy biggest complaint about this bakery is the price. I was soo shocked to hear my total was 60 bucks for the few desserts I picked! Charging 5.75 each for small nanaimo bars and twix bars is severely overpriced!

I love afghan food so it should be a win..win.\n\nThis place wasn't very business. It was clean and the decor was quite nice. I ordered the Beef & Chicken Kebab dinner. My wife ordered the Beef Seekh Kebab. The girl at the counter told us that one dinner wouldn't be enough for two people. We did want to share, but after hearing her advice we ordered two. Big mistake!!! Or a good mistake depending on how you might look at it.\n\nThe portions are huge!! But it was also very tasty, we ordered the dogh drink as well.

When it was time to get my manicure they told me that I had to re-pick my colours because the colours I picked were not shellac. Fine so I picked them and they got started. They did do a good job on my hands. \n\nOn to the pedicure, one of the guys did my pedicure, he asked me if I wanted the sea salt scrub so I said yes, then he said $5 more, so I said no thank you. Once he was done and my nails were drying I saw that he missed a few spots on the bottom of my heel. I told him and he kept saying that it was just the way my heel was, which i knew wasn't true he just didn't wanna fix it. \n\nNow comes paying. On the phone I was told $45. They told me I owed them $55. I asked them how come, they said because $5 for a design on my nails even though they didn't tell me that at the time and I don't know what they other $5 was for. Regardless I was not happy. \n\nOverall I might recommend this place to someone. I will see how long the shellac lasts first.\n\nI will definitely recommend this place.

The pizza was packed with ample fresh toppings, real sliced chicken breast, gooey melty mozzerella, and the sweet & spicy bbq sauce plus the crunch from the crispy salty bacon helped hit all the flavour bases.\n\nGnocchi Asiago - House made gnocchi with asiago cream sauce, spinach & crispy shallots\nWowww was this ever good! That lush rich creamy asiago cream sauce was soo delicious I wanted to drink up all the remnants left over after I ate all those plump pillowy gnocchis and the addition of the crispy shallots which were like mini onion rings added just the right crunch!\n\nTagliatelle Stefano - w/ slowly braised beef short ribs in tomato sauce\nPerfectly cooked al dente pasta and those tender flavourful fall off the bone meaty ribs were perfection.\n\nFinally onto the dessert which our waiter also recommended, totally knocked it out of the ball park!\n\nDouble Pistachio Gelato - Double scoop of creamy pistachio gelato evenly blended with real pieces of pistachios.\nPerfect balance of sweet and salty, loved the intense taste of pistachios with every bite and the crunchy bits of real pistachios evenly blended throughout plus the addition of the gingersnap biscuits on the side was a pleasant surprise. Pistachio is now my favourite flavour!\n\nOverall a spectacular meal from start to finish.

Sign up at the counter was quick and the customer service was great... of course it was.\n\nPlease, tell me if I'm missing something but all I saw was a room full of slots... and not a very big room at that (compared to other casinos I've been to). The only other thing I saw was a restaurant/bar area. Is that all there is to this place?\n\nOf course, as with any casino, it was packed to the rafters and it always amazes me to see people straddled over two chairs with wads of 20's in their hands feeding, not one, but two machines a seemingly endless supply. I don't get it but maybe it's just my age... no wait, some of these people have a good 30 years on me! Wait a minute! Aren't you on a fixed income lady? Oh, who am I to judge. ;)\n\nThe last time I played a slot machine it was in Seneca Casino (US) and I noticed two main differences: 1.

OVERALL this location is pretty good, due to 24/7 access and is decently maintained. There are some exceptions. \n\nIf you come to the gym later than 9PM, the one staff member seems to always go missing. So if something breaks, someone gets injured, or whatever, good luck finding the staff. Honestly, I feel like they're taking a nap somewhere - I can NEVER find them. They just leave the scanner and towels out. If you die during a 2AM workout, they'll find you in the morning. Just help yourself to the first aid kit since nobody else will. One of the girls who worked here didn't know what an instant ice pack was so I'm not sure how much you want to trust their first-aid skills. \n\nThis location has the hard rubber flooring, not the squishy kind near the weights. Deadlifts can be pretty loud, so be aware of your surroundings. You sometimes get the person who doesn't understand the concept of weightlifting yell at you for \"slamming the weights\" on a 300lb+ deadlift and how \"you're doing it wrong\" as he waves his gloved hands around explaining how to do it. That's great, but if you want silence go to a library. \n\nHere's a breakdown of what the gym is like throughout the week: \n\nOff-hours, including weekends, not including holidays:\nNot too busy and it's fairly relaxed in terms of trying to get equipment. You don't have to run for a power rack since usually one will be empty. Lots of room for deadlifts and exercises using battle ropes, sleds, box jumps and stuff. \n\nHolidays: \nGet here nice and early, and you'll probably get a good workout. Come here 3 hours before closing, you will have every person who forgot it was a holiday come to this gym because all the other locations within a 20km radius is closed. You'll get all the favourite types of gym-goers such as those who do unnecessary exercises in the power racks like bicep curls, dumbbell raises and squatting the bar. \n\nWeekdays, after work (5PM-7PM):\nNot as rough as some of the other clubs closer to Toronto/more populated cities like Markham. It's doable and these people are regulars so they just do their thing. Sometimes it does get a bit busy if you follow a \"typical\" lift schedule (i.e Mondays are Chest). \n\nOverall it's a good location since it has plenty of benches, power racks, and functional training equipment such as sleds.", "date": "2018-02-26 02:16:24"}

I was thankful for the lady being welcoming and helped me even if she knew I was there to only try small samples of cheeses. I'm not a cheese snob but I'm tired of regular cheese from the grocery store. \n\nRight away she knew I wanted to try Stilton Cheeses and when I told her I wanted fruity blue cheese, she had me try something from Montreal. She cut the piece of cheese for me and did her best to give me a perfect amount. She knew I was just expanding my knowledge in cheeses and was very enthusiastic about it. She didn't try to cut me a bigger slice than I wanted. It was as small as she can, as what I asked. \n\nI had the Mango Ginger Stilton Cheese from UK(apparently a best seller) and I so recommend it. I want to come back for more. I paired this cheese with white wine (reisling) from Niagara and a simple toast with Avocado. It was perfect guys! The smell of the cheese is amazing, fruity and had a creamy smell. \n\nThe fruity blue cheese was also perfect. I had it a little later than when I bought it, I completely forgot. Thankfully it was wrapped and bagged well. I enjoyed this with the egg sandwich. Add bacon if desired. The smell wasn't pungent but was definitely in the cheesy side. \n\nParking here is not too hectic, it's situated in a plaza near the 401 Salem exit. I didn't find the cheese expensive, I thought the prices were practical. For Antipasto for 50 people it's easy to spend about $100 for the cheese. \n\nThere are a few tables and not too many seating. The lighting is okay, it's not bright in there. I was also told that they cater to events, and i find their prep area (behind the counter) clean and organized. \n\nWhen you buy a piece of cheese, there will be a sticker, to make it easy to remember. On the sticker it has the name of cheese, where it's from, and the price. I remember a brief description included as well. \n\nI like how the cheese I got didn't have the wax part that came with. At some stores they also count the wax to weigh. I'm not sure if it had a wax case and if she took it off before weighing it. But I was pretty happy with it over all, if I were to buy a big piece. \n\nThey sell good variety of cheeses, a good alternative when you're not down town Toronto (Kensington Market).\n\nYou can also ask them for pairings. They are knowledgeable. They can tell you what wine to pair with it best. \n\nI would come back here again.", "date": "2017-04-11 04:20:22"}

If that is the case I should of been paying 5 bucks. \n\nI called the shop listen on yelp expecting its the number to the wash. Turns out it's the actual owner. Let me tell you guys what he decided to do this morning when I called to ask for the owner or manager. \n\nWhen I asked, he said \"why do you want the owner? What happened, why you calling\" \n\nI proceeded to tell him how the wash was horrible and I would like a refund or credit for another wash. Bite before I can mention that he decided he didn't care at all about me, the paying customer that's putting food on his fucking plate. So I called back, no answer. Call again and he starts to cuss at me, meanwhile still hasn't admitted he's the owner. I eventually found out he was the owner through my sources. I hope you are reading this, the owner who needs to get disciplined by his parents. You are a asshole, and don't deserve shit. I hope one day you realize your attitude can cost you.

For one, it is not at all clean.  From the moment you walk in, there is either an overwhelming smell of urine, or bleach mixed with urine.  Whether you leave your pet there for one day at daycare or for boarding, they will be returned to you reeking of urine, and gritty with dirt.  Dirt I can deal with.  Urine, no way.  You will not want to touch your dog after a stay here.  I know some dogs like to roll around in all sorts of things, but I had more than one dog here (one of which did not like to roll around) and they both reeked upon pickup.  I also knew 3 other pet owners who had similar experiences.  I chalked it up originally to standard \"kennel smell\" but have since taken my dogs to several other \"free play\" kennels and non-free play kennels-- they've never smelled the way they did at Ajax.\n\nThe worst thing though-- my dog was seriously injured while in the care of the Ajax Pet Centre.  I was told my dog was in a fight with another dog, and had started the fight.  However, both the vet and the surgeon who cared for my dog advised that the wounds inflicted indicate my dog was in a defensive position (bitten on the inside of the rear leg).  The other clue that my dog was not the aggressor was that there was no bleeding or inflammation around his mouth or gums, indicating that my dog had not bitten anything.  These two observations were made independently by both the vet and the surgeon.\n\nUnlike other petcare centres, Ajax does not provide \"doggy-cams\" for you to observe your dogs, or to witness the care they receive.

It's a slightly more upscale burger joint with nicer decor & ambiance than your average burger shack.  They do a few things to help separate them from other places, & give them a different identity.  Their prices are a bit higher than standard fast food places, more like Lick's or Five Guys Burgers & Fries.  For this review, I'll be comparing South St. head-to-head vs Five Guys.\n\nFirst, I'll start with the atmosphere, since it's one of the first things you notice when you walk in.  South St has nicer decor, furniture, & ambiance.  Like I said before, it feels more like a restaurant than Five Guys, which definitely has more of a fast-food feel to it.  When you're going out for a burger, you don't need anything fancy, but sometimes it's nice to sit at a table & not feel like you're sitting down to quickly wolf down your meal.  The food isn't served on standard plastic meal trays, but in aluminum pie pans, which is different.  Their tray liners are circular to fit the pie pans, & it's a neat idea that I'd never seen before.  South St definitely wins in this category.\n\nNext, I'll move on to the most important category & talk about the burgers.  South St. gives you the option of a white or whole grain kaiser, which is a nice choice to have, & not one offered at many burger joints.  The buns are done by a local bakery, & mine was nice & fresh.  They use hormone & antibiotic-free beef, while Five Guys website just states that they use \"fresh ground beef\" & that nothing is ever frozen.  South St gives you one large patty on their standard burger, whereas Five Guys gives you two smaller patties.  South St burgers are flame-grilled, compared to Five Guys & their flattop.  I prefer the flame-grilled taste, & the larger patty, so I've got to go with South St.  Their burger was cooked perfectly, & was very juicy.  Five Guys burgers were good too, but I have to side with South St on this one, although that's just my personal preference.  Another reason I think they're better is that they offer a wider array of toppings & sauces, as well as five different kinds of cheese to choose from.  They offer four different types of mustard, two kinds of ketchup, four relishes, three different mayos & three kinds of sauces to enhance & personalize your burger.  A tidbit on Five Guys' website states that there are over 250,000 possible ways to order a burger at Five Guys, & because I suck at math, I can only guess that means there's over 1,000,000 different ways to order at South St.  Another important factor to consider is price, & whereas Five Guys will charge you $6.49 for a regular burger, South St's price is only $5.75, & you get a $1.00 discount if you buy a combo, unlike Five Guys.\n\nNext is the battle of the fries, which some people would argue is as important as the burgers.  South St uses New York Fries, whereas Five Guys uses freshly cut, homemade fries.  Even though South St's website states that their NYF are hand-cut daily from fresh potatoes as well, the edge here goes to Five Guys.  Their fries are better than some chip trucks I've been to, & the portion is massive.  Two people can easily split an order of their fries, & even though a regular order of fries is $1.00 more than South St, it's well worth the extra dollar.  The NYF portion is standard & I just didn't enjoy their fries as much.  Even though they have several different seasonings to use on the fries, Five Guys have got them beat here.\n\nMiscellaneous factors, Five Guys offers free refills, & while South St might offer them too (I don't know), you'd have to go back up to the counter to get it, which is a pain, particularly if you're there at a busy time.  It's nicer when you can just go refill your own cup, so Five Guys gets another nod here.  The free peanuts offered by Five Guys surely appeal to some, but I doubt anyone goes there specifically for that reason.  Besides, those peanuts are so incredibly over-salted, that you should be entitled to those free refills by law.  One other small thing that South St does better than Five Guys is their website.  Their menu actually has prices on it, so you can see for yourself what things will cost, & you're not soiling your pants when you find out your total.  Also, South St uses local businesses for supplies & lists many different ways that they \"go green\" whenever possible.  Some people might not care, but I think it's nice to see a business with a conscience.\n\nSo after all that, I've got to give the edge to South St. Burger Co. over Five Guys Burgers & Fries.  Aside from the flame-grilled burgers & wide array of toppings & sauces, they were a slightly better value, they did more of the \"little things\" right, which is why I gave them three stars to Five Guys' two.  I'm still waiting for Big Boy's Burgers to open in Whitby, & I'll be sure to post on them ASAP.  In the spirit of Christmas, Season's Eatings, everyone!", "date": "2011-12-20 10:06:56"}

Mind you, it tasted pretty much like any other bacon cheeseburger but I loved how generous they were with the bacon! Bacon is life, afterall.  Also, the burger was huge.  I can't believe I actually ate the whole thing.  I guess it was that good that I didn't want to really take any home.  Instead, I brought home the rest of the fries and their delicious gravy.  4/5.\n\nSpeaking of their gravy, make sure you get a side of gravy if you're going to have fries.  It's absolutely delicious and the portion is big that 2-3 people can share it.  5/5.\n\nNow, their coffee is probably the best out there next to McDonald's.

I went for the Vivier peel. The cleansing part before the peel was more uncomfortable than the actual peel. She really made sure your skin is prepped for the application. It was tingly and there was a little heat, but nothing I couldn't handle.\n\nI was told how to take care of my skin after and what to expect. I would've liked a check list or something to take with me. After a few days, I was forgetting what Kate had told me to do. \n\nThe peeling process was interesting. I think I expected to peel like snake skin, but this was not the case. It was gradual, not shocking. I almost felt like I should peel more than I did, but I'm not sure if that was my fault because I forgot to do what Kate told me! (Oops!) My skin has definitely lost that dull hue and I have a nice glow. Perfect time of year for a peel!\n\nKate was very professional and made it a calming experience.

Could have been planned better.\n\nThe restaurant is pleasant, with nice full-length windows to look out on the racetrack, a great view with a few horses exercising.\n\nThe food is okay, though I can never understand why any chef thinks frozen French fries are acceptable to eat.\n\nService, unfortunately, was worse than poor.  Staff is apparently untrained, same as at other OLG casinos, where the attitude seems to be that if the food or most of it somehow gets to you and not too much of it is spilled or forgotten, and you don't mind eating your soup and cold main course at the same time, the customer should be satisfied.  \"I don't know\" should be an acceptable answer to questions about the food, and \"I'm new here\" should excuse any other mistakes a waiter makes.\n\nIn this case we ordered 2 soups and 2 main courses after struggling with the waitress's total lack of understanding of the menu.  So we were both having the same thing.  After a long, long time, one of the soups was delivered by a different waitress.  When we asked about the other soup, she explained that she had seen the one soup sitting in the kitchen and knew it was for our table so brought it out. Never a thought that there were two of us.  Then she chatted in a corner with other staff, forgetting us.\n\nAfter another long wait, the other soup arrived with the 2 main courses.  I mean, give me a break.  When asked to keep my companion's main course warm until he ate his soup, the plate disappeared until much later, when it came out cold.  A similar experience to the Blue Heron restaurant - are they conspiring against us?\n\nThis restaurant was an ordeal I do not want to repeat.

This particular Cineplex is located at Highway 2 and Salem on the east side of Salem, north of Highway 2 in the Home Depot/Canadian Tire plaza.\n\nThis has never been one of my favourite theaters, probably because its poorly laid out and that can cause some issues. When we came in, there was a HUGE lineup of people waiting and since I was using a gift certificate, we had to wait too instead of going to the faster self service kiosks. A note, as with any cineplex, any 3D movie requires an additional fee if you're using a gift certificate. And no, you don't get scene points on that :(\n\nMy main issue with this theater is the concessions area. Not only is it wide open but there's no discernible lines. It's hard to tell which cashier is open and available and people are constantly butting in line, making the wait for popcorn rather annoying. On a very busy night, this place is insane so beware.\n\nAll of the theaters here are fairly small as far as theaters go. Not super sloped so if you get stuck behind a tall person, you might be SOL.

My cannelloni had cheese inside, cheese outside and cheese all over. The sauce could've used something; it was a plain tomato sauce.

I was however, pleasantly surprised as I generally get really excited when trying a new place that's a little more of a greasy spoon/Mom & Pop's type of place.  My friend also kept raving about their Eggs Florentine so I had to opt for something close to that so I got a traditional Eggs Benny.\n\nI'm quite picky when it comes to Eggs Benny as it's one of my favourite breakfast items.  It's always something I order through in-room dining when I travel and stay at our properties (I work for Four Seasons).  I must say that their Eggs Benny is better than some of the ones I've had at some of our properties.  Their portion is very very generous, with up to 3 thick slices of Canadian bacon on 2 slices of English muffin, perfectly poached eggs and a generous amount of Hollandaise sauce.  The only thing I do wish for was for the Hollandaise sauce to have a little bit more of that lemony zest, but it was actually still very good.  \n\nThe one thing I need to stress is how perfectly poached their eggs were.  The lovely waitress also first asked us how we wanted our eggs (we all got Eggs Florentine or Eggs Benny), and that alone proves that they know what they're doing.  I went to this one restaurant that pretty much gave a hardboiled egg.  Yanno.\n\nSo on top of the very friendly service in a very casual, welcoming restaurant, their food is definitely worth continued visits.  I'm sure they already get many returning customers, including my friends, and I will definitely be going back to this place.  All-day breakfast for the win! Also, their coffee is really good.  \n\nStraight up 5/5!", "date": "2016-09-12 14:38:35"}

My boyfriend and I came in here on a Tuesday evening around 7.\n\nWe were seated right away  and were given a specials/extras menu as well as the regular menu - on Tuesdays pizzas are only $10 and they had a few extra specials they were offering this month. We ended up ordering a mini pizzetta which had cheese, sauce and prosciutto on it and I went with the Gnocci Asiago and my boyfriend got the Lamb Shank.\n\nShortly after we ordered we had some bread delivered to the table while we waited for our appetizer. Now I may be nitpicking, but at a restaurant that looks as nice as this one does and has some amazing fire grilled pizza, you'd think they could NOT give out butter packs. I would have preferred to see a little container of butter or something instead of a bunch of butter packs thrown in. The bread was good, nothing amazing but a nice start.\n\nThe mini pizzetta was quite good, thin crust, not too much sauce, enough cheese for it to be stringy and good sized slices of prosciutto. I think the only thing I would change about this is to make the pieces of prosciutto smaller since there was only one piece (maybe two) per side and they were hard to bite through in one bite so they would slide off the pizza. Otherwise, a nice start to our meal.\n\nThe Gnocci Asiago was quite good, I had quickly popped on yelp to see if anyone recommended anything and this one stood out. Soft pillowy gnocci tossed in an asiago cream sauce with baby spinach and crispy onion strings on top. While the sauce was rich, it wasn't super heavy and neither was the gnocci. It's hard to find good gnocci that aren't gummy or chewy and these were melt in your mouth amazing. I couldn't finish the entire thing but I kept going back for more even after I said I was finished. \n\nI did try a bit of the lamb shank and while my boyfriend quite enjoyed it, it didn't do it for me. The lamb was a bit dry and the potoatoes weren't anything special but since I only had one bite, I can't really give an accurate description. \n\nOverall, we really enjoyed our meal, good food, good service and a nice atmosphere in the restaurant.

What?!\n\nNaturally, as someone who loves visiting grocery stores, I have a new goal, which is to visit the ones just east of me. I decided to give the location in Ajax a visit yesterday, since it's the closest one to me.\n\nI used to visit Ajax fairly often a few years back. What I didn't know is that this store (it's still known as Almost Perfect, so branding isn't consistent) is in the heart of downtown Ajax. I had no idea that there was a downtown. Then again, I can see why it isn't advertised. This plaza throws you back to what it looked like in the 70's and still looks like now. It's a bit shabby and ghetto, but who cares when you walk into this store!\n\nThe store is next to Ajax Bowl, which seems to be in an office building. It must be interesting to be working in that office and hearing pins fall in the background.\n\nThere was plenty of parking. I thought that this plaza was a ghost town at first. However, there are other stores that had more cars parked in front, such as Rexall.\n\nI walked in. This store is larger than the Toronto location. I was immediately greeted with a display of crisp bread and salami chips. I got two packages of the latter. They are tasty as snacks.\n\nThis store has a variety of items at cheap prices. It basically takes over-productions or imperfect food items and sells them at cheap prices. Nice!\n\nI loved the frozen breakfast items. You can get apple crepes, egg white and regular egg patties, sausage patties, and more. There were also vegan meat items, such as vegan bacon and shrimp. The Chinese frozen section looked cool. I may need to give the five-spice pork a shot the next time that I am there.\n\nI liked that the TRUE line of citrus crystals are available. When I am travelling, I like having lemons in my hot tea, but it may not be convenient to buy and slice up lemons. I buy the lemon TRUE packets and they are perfect. I bought a pack of orange ones. They are also cheap at $1.49 a box. At my local low-carb store, it's nearly three times as much.\n\nThe candy section is impressive. I love that Reese minis are available in both milk and white chocolate. You must give the latter a try. I got hooked on the regular white chocolate cups several years ago. They are delicious!\n\nThe desserts looked amazing. My regular cakey cookies were there. So were amazing-looking key lime pies. There are also vegan Sweets From the Earth cheezecakes and gluten-free goodies.\n\nI checked out. There wasn't a lineup. The woman was helpful. I had a bag, so I avoided having my stuff loaded in either a box or a plastic bag. I bought a ton of stuff and it was just over $30. I was a happy camper.\n\nThis store had frozen cubed turnips for well under $5. It's perfect for me when I make my version of zuppa toscana, substituting potatoes for turnips. I made said soup hours after coming back from my shopping trip and it was yummy.\n\nI love this store. I'll be back.\n\n(339)", "date": "2018-09-16 20:18:44"}

I must think if my $3500.00 custom sofa as an expensive loss/mistake. Word to the wise, do not be impressed by the items in the showroom. You will not receive the product as you ordered. If you order a fabric you will not receive the same quality as what you are led to believe. After many months of trying the only option I had was to accept three replacement casings (there are 6 pulled and snagged) it was the same defective fabric. Never was replacement of the defective sofa even a possibility. \n\nI did not receive the quality sofa I payed for in good faith. The staff, most especially customer service, have little to no authority to make things right for the customer even when they see a legitimate problem, which they did acknowledge in my case. \n\nMy only recourse is to review Sklar Peppler online where I can, as well as no longer recommend this company to my clients. I will watch with anticipation as this company slips into bankruptcy once again, due to their lack of concern for their customers. I am just one person, however I regret not buying from a big box store. Buy from Costco, IKEA, The Bay, based on their ability to honour warranties and stand behind what they sell. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am in the design industry and over the years have sent countless clients to Sklar Peppler, I regret this now! \n\nI had two wonderful sofas from them in 2007 (pre bankruptcy) So for my most recent personal purchase I thought of going nowhere else. Boy do I regret this decision. I was not aware Sklar Peppler had gone BANKRUPT and were bought by an American company Alan white interiors. This is no longer Sklar Peppler it is Alan White of the USA (check out their history in depth) it is not Canadian made, in fact i am suggesting it is not even American made. It is my belief that the goods are made elsewhere in the world. There is no identification on my sofa that says \"proudly made in the USA\" like the Americans always do WHEN THEY MAKE A PRODUCT THEY ARE PROUD OF. If you are going to Sklar Peppler because you think they are reputable, save yourself the money and aggravation. Do your research first, they are owned by Allan White in the USA - look up their reviews and all the horror stories where people have had bad product. My fabric was showing wear within a week, we purchased a $3500.00 sectional we have two clean adults in our home. We have had zero satisfaction from Sklar peppler. I believe they are dragging their heels on this so that we will be out of warranty. Not one person thus far, in the chain of command is able to make a decision on what will happen with our defective sofa. They are still trying to peddle me new cushion covers! The whole sofa is covered in this faulty fabric! My impression is the owners will not give any authority to their staff, they are not empowered with making decisions. They say no and make their employees do their dirty work, by passing on bad news to their customers.\n\nI have had some dealings with genuine staff members who would like to help us, and acknowledge that the sofa is prematurely worn, but have proven they have no authority to correct this for us. They need customer service reps that can reverse their failing reputation of bad service. I have even said to the reps I have spoken to that I would look elsewhere for a job and not work for these people. We have even had staff to our home and they have seen the fabric and acknowledge it is not proper wear for a sofa two months old. \nApparently they sent a sample fabric to their \"mill\" aka china, to see if they had had other problems with this fabric. The report came back stating it was not liable to replace the sofa because they detected dog hair on the fabric and a hitch in the fabric apparently this was a sign of abuse. \n\nWe own a 2.5 pound yorkie that is hypoallergenic, non shedding, and is not allowed on the sofa. Nice try to wiggle out of liability. So who is responsible I ask? Should I just suck it up and stop dwelling on how ripped off I got? I hate to waste money, money doesn't flow like lava but releasing this from my mind is the only way I can free myself from the growing lack of respect I have I have for SKLAR PEPPLER.", "date": "2017-02-09 00:35:01"}

Turn off number two, the shrimp were not de-veined meaning we had to put even that much more effort into our dinner. The only thing we didn't have to do was kill the shrimp ourselves really. The mussels were okay. The broccoli was $7 for not even a head of broccoli, menu says it would come in garlic sauce but it was just steamed with butter. The potato was just that, a potato in a bag, cut in half and tasteless. I would tell you about the rice, but unfortunately or not, it never made it to our table. After struggling with a few shrimp and one or two crab legs, we gave up frustrated. We really just wanted to leave and were completely turned off by the whole experience.

After only a few days of light use it was clear the fabric was cheap, worse than the cheapest scratchiest upholstery you could find, at the cheapest no name, or big box store. It hurts your elbows to even rest your arms on it. To think I actually paid extra to upgrade my fabric, it can't possibly be what I picked in the showroom. I am in the design field and am very familiar with quality fabrics. The cushions crushed the first time they were sat on, and never bounced back, back cushions are under filled and baggy, and the piping is sewn rippled, the fabric has big pulls and snags already, regardless of being in a well kept home with two careful adults. The red flag from the get go was the light beige zippers used on a charcoal grey sofa. No attention to detail obviously. And the down filled throw cushions sewn right up without zippers at all (that's the height of cheap, I have to wonder what's really in them) \n\nCustomer service is shameful, no talk of replacement. I live local and have bought two sofas from Sklar Peppler before and have referred many clients to the Ajax store over the years. However, I have since learned that the real Sklar Peppler went bankrupt in 2006 (look it up) they ripped off all it's employees of severance. (They actually made quality furniture back in the day) then somehow resurface as \"Allan White Furniture\" apparently taking the manufacturing to the USA - however I, as well as several other online dissatisfied customers have done some digging and feel that the product is likely made in CHINA (thus the long wait and inferior quality) Some people have actually received their supposed \"SKLAR PEPPLER authentic\" furniture plastered with MADE IN CHINA stickers all over the bottom (oops someone forgot to remove the stickers!) on my sectional there is no branding label authenticating that it is actual \"Sklar Peppler\" or where it is made - At the very least neither my fabric, nor the construction of my sofa is that of the superior quality I trusted it to be. It is nothing but a cheap knock off, that cost me $3500.00 what a waste of hard earned money. Do NOT buy from them, there are absolutely no returns regardless of what they tell you when they are trying to sell to you. I have given up on this company, I have accepted that this will never be remedied to my satisfaction, my only recourse is to post my story in reviews so that others will be educated about the potential for great personal loss financially.

Just a sloppy, ridiculous establishment that completely ruined what was meant to be a special evening. The worst part is that they do not care. I'll be glad when this place is \"Closed Permanently\".", "date": "2016-10-26 22:01:28"}

It's always nice to come to a sit down restaurant where the staff are so pleasant. \n\nWe started off with deep fried chicken wings. The wings meat was juicy and cooked really well. Then we got shrimp in lobster sauce. I found it a bit on the salty side but honestly, I don't much care for shrimp anyway.  My boyfriend ordered a yellow curry chicken. It was really spicy but the flavor was great! The waitress let us know that you can request for less to no spicy haha. After all, they want to make sure it's edible for everyone.\n\nI ordered the beef pad Thai. It was a bit sweeter than I'm use to but it has just enough tart flavoring to make it really appetizing.

First of all, she's not exactly a foodie and second, she's not a big red meat eater however she kept raving about their Braised Beef Short Rib. I'll get to that shortly. \n\nWe went on a weeknight so the place was empty, though we heard that Thursday night is one of their busier nights with live entertainment. Although we were one of very few tables, the service was still very friendly. We had a server named Sheantelle whose knowledge of the menu item were impressive. She also shared with us her top picks. The bartender was also very knowledgeable and honest as a friend of mine was wanting a drink with less sugar and was asking for any kind of alternative. He was honest and explained to her that with that particular drink, it would be impossible. Coming from the hospitality industry and having dined at 4 and 5 star restaurants, we appreciated this feedback.  The service alone I'd rate 5/5. Now, come the food reviews. \n\n**Update** Went here last night and Cameron served us.  He was the only server last night since it's a slower night.  Although there were more walk-ins that came in later in the evening, Cameron was able to tackle the floor.  After a mix-up with our Shrimp Platter order, he was completely understanding and still left a positive vibe for the unfortunate incident (shrimps were undercooked and cold). My rating of 5/5 for the service still stands.\n\n[Appetizers & Sides] \nJerk Chicken Poutine - One of the best I've ever had and I try to stay away from potatoes due to the sugar levels but I couldn't resist. If I had died from a diabetic coma after this poutine, I'd die happy. Normally when it comes to poutine, I'm all about the cheese curds and the gravy. This had neither. They used white and yellow cheddar melted with a spicy chicken gravy and of course, jerk chicken. The jerk chicken was perfectly seasoned and I'm guessing it was grilled (to perfection). I'd go back just for this poutine. Although listed as an app, the portion was more like a meal portion. Definitely something I'd recommend if you're just feeling peckish and are wanting  to try something a little different. 5/5\n\nCallaloo Dip - Pretty much a new favourite at RD. First off, where else will you be able to have dip with callaloo? On top of the delicious appetizer, it was accompanied by tortilla chips and fried naan which was amazing especially when it comes out so fresh.  Four of us shared the dip and even had a some dip leftover so Cameron was generous enough to bring us some extra fried naan.  I'd personally go back for this dip. 5/5.\n\nFried Plantain - A staple side for any Caribbean restaurant.  Although the presentation was very nice, was really nothing spectacular.  The slices were thin, though, nicely fried.  I prefer the slices to be a bit thicker and even on its own (ie. minus the rum butter sauce). 3.5/5.\n\n[Entree] \nLobster Mac & Cheese - I was personally expecting chunks of lobster baked in with the Mac & Cheese but you actually get a lobster tail. Wasn't the biggest tail size and the Mac & Cheese itself was nothing spectacular, though, we still enjoyed this dish. Paying $21 may be a little too much but it's acceptable. 4.5/5.\n\nBraised Beef Short Ribs - As with my friend, red meat is not my first pick but because she herself kept raving about it as well as our server, we had to try it and I am very happy that we did. The Flintstones sized portion was slow braised to perfection that the meat literally fell off the bone and melted in your mouth. It also had just enough fat, though, it was still quite lean. I'm sure if I was able to see it in its raw state, it probably would've had a nice marble look to it. Not only was it perfectly braised but it was also braised in rum and molasses. The entree was also served with a large serving of sweet potato mash and grilled vegetables. All of which were also nicely cooked. They were also simple yet flavourful. The portion size is definitely worth $21 if not more. 5/5.\n\nSouthern Fried Chicken Supreme Breast (aka Chicken & Waffles) - Now, I'm a big fan of chicken and waffles. One of my go-to spots in L.A. is actually Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles.  But seeing as RD is obviously a higher scale than Roscoe's, it'll be a little different.  The difference is that the chicken was breaded but more with bread crumbs. The meat was white meat which was quite juicy.  The breading also had a nice crisp to it.  However, the chicken itself lacked a little bit of flavor but then the spicy maple syrup complimented it quite nicely.  The waffle was freshly made and was light and quite airy.  The dish also came with a side of vegetables.  The portion of the chicken was pretty small and personally, I didn't feel that the price was worth it (even though I was treated for the night). 3.5/5.\n\nI will definitely be coming back here and this may very well be one of my new go to spots out in the East end.", "date": "2015-05-14 04:51:10"}

My wife and I have been to this place 3 times in the past month and that's because the wings are good.  They have a nice smokey flavour that you don't get at most places and you get good portions.   That being said.. they've been different each time we've gone.  The first time they seemed more smoked.. I don't know.  They were soft and juicy and seemed like they were cooked by a chef and were timed perfectly in the oven (or whatever they use).  The second time they were more like other places.. they were crispy like they were just dunked in a deep fryer for X amount of minutes and put on a plate.  They were still good but they seemed more generic.  The third time they were somewhere in between.   So based on the wings I'd suggest going to Mackenzie's.\n\nOk now here is the hard part.

We entered the place, and saw place is big with a few occupied tables. First impression - didn't look good that the receiving area was full of folded napkins, and stuff. Didn't look professional, Cant they do that in the back room?\n~ We were greeted by a waitress in her early to mid- 20s had us  seated. As with any Groupon voucher, I always tell the server ahead of time that I have a Groupon voucher. So when I did, she said: \"Honestly I haven't seen that Groupon voucher\".

Suggestion : have a menu ready printed for Groupon voucher users.\n~ Hubby and I ended up checking my Groupon phone app to see what we can order.\n~ We placed our orders Jerk chicken nachos - a good portion, Jerk chicken linquine which was good and the chicken and waffles - this was okay but the veggies tasted and smelled like fuel???!!! \n~ Close to finishing our main dishes, the manager approached us and said the Jerk chicken nachos was not part of the Groupon voucher. So hubby said the Groupon fine print said jerk chicken - it was vague. Come to think of it -  the appetizer section has Jerk Chicken Poutine and Jerk Chicken Nachos , which are possible selections. So we chose nachos only to find out it is not part of the voucher. Why didn't the server inform us then?  - then we would not have made the mistake of picking that. Mgr said only the poutine is included. So I told the manager if she can adjust my bill since the nachos is $2 more than the poutine. Mgr said \"oh I cant do that.\" (I didn't want to ruin my \"date\" with hubby ) So she suggested that I take home the poutine and the nachos is addl to my bill!! OMG..My frustration was building up.\n~ We ordered dessert. Rum Brulee . It came after a looooong looonnng wait. and when we got it I haven't seen a brulee that runny.\n~ Now, check out time.

But I just felt so frustrated after this experience. \n -  If  resto manager knew there was a breakdown in communicating the groupon details (and even the Groupon fine print was vague as well!!) - then offer the customer a compromise and allow the price adjustment.

Once you get through the top layer you basically have naked tostitoe chips. There was hardly any jerk chicken in it as well. \n\nSpring rolls (Ackee and Salted cod) - $16 (score 4/5)\nThese were really good, however it was only 3 spring rolls cut in half diagonally. Not enough spring rolls for the price. \n\nWings (Dry Cajun rub) - $14 (score 3/5) \nNothing special. Can't go wrong with wings. \n\nOne member of our party mentioned that the Jerk Chicken Coconut Linguini was really good.\n\nAround 10:30pm, they will start to rearrange the tables, to open up the floor. The DJ will start to setup his station, and this place will shortly turn into a club/lounge. Coat check is $3, and I'm pretty sure there is a cover charge (not sure of the fee, since we were already there for diner) The vibe is old/new reggae, R'n'B, etc.\n\nI was really disappointed with the extremely slow service, and the nachos. The main entrees are all overpriced. I would prefer to eat at the local jerk chicken / carribean spot, rather then come here. \n\nI would come back hear not for the food, but later on in the evening for the club.", "date": "2017-12-19 00:19:11"}

I said most because our server forgot to punch in the Cannelloni. Ooops! She discovered the error soon enough and apologized several times. The Cannelloni arrived and we were offered a complimentary dessert for the error. We opted for an order of the Coconut Shrimp.\n\nAll the food arrived on hot plates, nicely presented. The portions were huge! Everything tasted good, very good. The BBQ sauce on the ribs and wings was of the sweeter variety and was delicious. The nachos were colourful and had a variety of toppings. We ended up taking half of it home because it was a lot. The cannelloni was very rich and cheesy. The veal schnitzel was well cooked and the mushroom gravy was very tasty. The coconut shrimp was also very good.\n\nDespite the ordering glitch, it was a very pleasant dining experience. The food and service were good and the prices were very reasonable.

I'm sure something terrible must have happened to her today to make her in such a bad mood, but the way I was talked to was worse than I've been treated since I can remember. \n\nEverything she said was SO INCREDIBLY RUDE and everything was with so much attitude. She was also SO SLOW MOVING. Like I said, I was the first and only customer when I got there  and it took me over 30 minutes to get out of there... 10 minutes of which was waiting at the till for her to tell me my total.\n\n I ordered 2 6 inch combos with fountain pops and cookies for both and I thought each combo came with 2 cookies, for a total of 4 cookies with 2 combos.... she informed me that despite what the menu said, each combo only came with 1 cookie. So I said okay cancel the 2 other cookies then, I JUST want whatever comes with 2 combos. and then she couldn't get the machine to take off my initial order I guess and she snapped at me \"LOOK AT WHAT YOU DID, THE COMPUTERS NOT WORKING IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT!!!\" .. \n\nI look online later and it does say each combo comes with 2 cookies not 1 so I am so confused!!! \n\n She also got mad, actually ANGRY at me and made me feel so stupid when I ordered \"white chocolate macadamia nut cookies\" because she told me i need to clarify weather it's chocolate or regular... well if it was chocolate I wanted I would have added in the word chocolate. But that was her reaction to everything... when i ordered flat bread she yelled (literally yelled) \"YOU NEED TO TELL ME WHITE OR MULTIGRAIN\" \n\nLike I said, it took me over 10 minutes with her standing at the computer trying to punch in my order (I was watching my phone timing her at this point) before I was able to pay and leave. \n\nI still am just in shock, I have never been actually yelled at by somebody in LONG TIME let alone somebody at a restaurant whether it's fast food or not. I don't expect great customer service at a fast food place but honestly, to be not yelled at and treated like a human being would be just perfect for me.\n\nI came in Sunday January 15 just before 9pm, left after 9:30pm, and I would love some follow up from management about that woman.

Great guy, great customer service. He goes above and beyond for his clients, namely myself. Most agents would try and screw you just to make their commission and have 0 regard for you and your real wants and needs, but Engelo cares more about the satisfaction of his clients than he does the money factor. As long as he can find you a suitable car to better you and your life then that's all that matters to him. We went through a 3 month saga of trying to finance myself for the first time. Nowhere else would help me. Even credit rebuilding places wouldn't help me much and were trying to stick it to me with ridiculous 28% interests. I'm a 26 year old male that is only just trying to finally build his credit and since I've needed a car for quite some time I figured this was my best option. I just didn't realize it would become as difficult as it was. Then I met engelo, he patiently went through all of the vehicles that fit my lifestyle and my personal requests, and narrowed it down to one (this took me about 3 weeks just to make a decision).  This all happened beginning of June 2017 and finally beginning of September 2017 we found a bank willing to finance myself for an appropriate rate of 15%. Still a little high technically , but in comparison to all the high 20%+ I was being offered everywhere else this was a Steal!\n\nNow I'm finally on the road again and I couldn't be happier! For all your new and used car needs I HIGHLY RECOMMEND paying a visit to Engelo over at Ajax Mazda, even if you live in Richmond Hill like myself or further. It's worth the trip and your time, I promise you that.\nThanks Engelo! And good luck to everybody out there car searching :)", "date": "2017-09-11 16:11:31"}

Haircuts are always ok, not amazing but not terrible. It should be called \"Average Clips\" not great clips.", "date": "2015-02-18 19:36:04"}

The calamari were crispy and the 2 dips delicious.

He was good, but I don't think I've ever been hammered for drink orders as much as I was this night. Became a bit annoying. My hubby ordered a beer to come with the steak (which, after the steak was delivered he had to remind them of when they asked us again if we wanted drinks - and then they didn't even have the beer). This is the only reason they lost a star. \n\nIn the confusion they found the scallops which were cooked perfectly. The seafood sauce served with them is WAY too overpowering. Needs a brown sugar or teriyaki sauce. \n\nI love the bacon-wrapped filet and it is always tender and cooked to perfection as it was on this very busy night.

Just then the phone rang and it was daughter returning her mothers call. I can tell by the exchange of the conversation. I knew right then she did not call the lady. I ignored it and she said since my mom lived near by she would drop it to my mother. I agreed. Then she was eying what she sewed complimenting herself and i agreed she sewed my daughters dress very nicely. Mine not so much but I didnt care as my daughters was good. She then said while she was sewing our clothes her needle kept getting stuck in the machine. At that point I knew this lady lied about hiring someone else to sew our clothes and she had taken my extra material to sew it for her daughter. But i kept quiet paid her in full and told her i will expect the cloth to be dropped to my mothers home which is by the store by tuesday which was 4 days away. She didn't drop it or call us. So i called her on thursday and she gave me some sob story about the lady being sick. So i am like okay i will be in area sunday so will call her then for it. She said sure no problem. I called her sunday still some sob story but now she started fighting with me and yelling at me for not trusting her a total stranger and then she disconnected the call on me. I called her back as this was expensive material and at this point this lady was very rude. She said she will drop it to my mother house by 7 pm. Of course she is a liar so she didn't. I finally called her back today tuesday and out of anger she dropped off the cloth to my mother but she gave me back 0.75 meters instead of 2 meters and she cut it in shreds. The lady has some nice clothes there in her store, but she is a liar and a thief if you do have to shop there buyer beware. But never ever get your clothes sewn  from there unless you give her the exact material.", "date": "2018-01-24 02:35:01"}

I am generally a big huge Keg fan and this was my second time within a month that I was going to get me some Keg steak. I took my boyfriend to this location for his birthday dinner.\n\nWe came in on a Tuesday and while it wasn't super busy (no line up or wait to be seated) it was surprisingly full. We were seated towards the back at a table for two and poked around the menu for a bit. Our server came over and we aleady knew what we wanted so we ordered our meals and drinks at the same time. We both got the NY steak Classic Dinner with garlic mashed (classic dinner comes with mushrooms and a caesar to start). \n\nSomething about the bread and that whipped butter here always gets me. I always eat too much of it, but its super tasty and always fresh.Our caesars arrived not long after the bread. I have to say that the caesar is probably the biggest letdown at the Keg for me. I've had better caesars before and its always a smidge over dressed for me. Still tasty though, I ate most of mine and stopped to save room. Our steaks came out and I'd asked for medium and my boyfriend medium rare. They were done properly but I felt like mine could have been a bit more pink (but that's being a bit finnicky). Super tasty steak, garlic mashed were great and I ended up taking about half home for leftovers because there was a lot of food!\n\nAs we were here for my boyfriend's birthday I had told the server at the beginning of the meal and we finished off with Billy Miner Pie, which is incredible. I don't know what makes it so great but it really is. She put a candle in it and everything which was a nice touch.\n\nI did feel like our service was a bit slow, it took a while for our server to come over and then for our drinks and then for our plates to be taken away and then forever for the bill to come. She was very pleasant though and if the restaurant had been busier, I wouldn't have been bothered by the waits.\n\nOverall, a great Keg experience, we'll be back again for the next special occasion!", "date": "2013-06-04 15:21:52"}

So tonight we go in, and OMG! It's got an all-you-can-eat option. The last time I had all-you-can-eat sushi was back in NYC when I didn't know what good sushi tasted like. So, with apprehension we enter the restaurant. I was surprised at how elegant the decor was; beautiful white, green and cream colors with dark wood furniture and accents. Slate floors and comfortable white leather chairs. If I didn't live thousands of miles away I would steal these lovely chairs. Okay but let's get to the food. \n\nWe did decide to go with the all-you-can-eat option. We ordered a ton of food. Miso soup, crunchy green salad with a tasty dressing (really you should try this dressing at least once). Veggie tempura was  good and not over battered. selection was good and you could just order the items you like. We liked them all. California roll and Rainbow roll were good - not great, but decent. Beef short ribs were great, tender and not too fatty. We also ordered the sushi pizza. I was more curious than scared, but we opted for a veggie one, to be safe. It was delicious. It came on a fried rice patty, like a hash brown but with rice, a spicy sriracha sauce on the rice and a mix of yummy veggies and topped with creamy avocado. If we didn't already order too much food, I'd have gotten a second one. Then we had sashimi! We ordered a bunch of pieces, some butter fish, white fish (both were good) some squid (so much better than we thought - we'd never had this before and it was rich and creamy, not chewy at all) and a ton of salmon. The pieces were SO generously cut. I would recommend ordering less so that you don't get too full too soon. The wait staff was nice and quick with our order. I was a little nervous seeing so much food on the table but we managed to eat it all and had a little bit of room left for ice cream. This is a great place and has tons of cooked food options for friends not interested in sushi. Next time time I'm here, I'll be back.", "date": "2009-09-02 00:39:01"}

The only time available was 10pm.\nI asked many questions about the reservations as it is a lounge/resto and these things can be tricky to deal with when you have to move tables for people to dance. I asked if we would be rushed or moved by having our table so late in the night knowing they would be turning it into club/lounge by midnight.\nI was told the only way I would have to move is if they happen to put us in an area that is on the dance floor. If not, than we would be free to keep our table for picking on appetizers, ordering drinks, etc.\n\nWhen I got to RD at 9:55, I was told to sit at the bar and our table would be ready soon. 10-15 min later no table. My bf went to ask which table were they seating us at and apparently they were waiting on this party of over 20 people to wrap up so we can have the table. I was upset by this b/c I did ask when making reservations how they plan on accommodating my party if a large party before us is there and plans on staying all night. I was told \"It should be fine. Shouldn't be a problem.\" \nWe didn't get our table until near 11pm!!!\nI had a party of 15 people too. So, we were all bunched around at the bar waiting to be seated for about an hour.\n\nOnce we were seated, everyone ordered. Mixed opinions on the food. Some people said it was mediocre, while others really liked it. I personally liked the Lobster Mac n' Cheese and Beef/Chicken Satay Skewers that I tried.\n\nThey rushed our party through eating and then told us close to midnight that we need to leave the table so they can give our table to another party...\nUmmm what??? You sat us at our table an hour late!!! Once I expressed my frustration, they left my party alone for the night. The following day my girlfriends told me they tried to order me a slice of cake to sing me Happy Birthday but they were told  the kitchen is closed. Huh???\nWe're not asking you to bake a dang cake... we are asking you to slice a pre-made dessert you have in the back that we will be PAYING for and it wasn't late in the night when it was requested either.\n\nOther than those disappointing factors, it turned into 90's hip hop and rnb night so the music was great!\nThe prices are average compared to a  Moxies or Milestones.\n\nI would go back for a random club night but never for an occasion.", "date": "2015-03-10 14:46:38"}

The waitress said she doesn't know what rum is available on the special. She then went to check with the manager. More than half hour waiting we sat there waiting for one of the two choices of liquor on special. I told the waitress three times I am here for the drinks, she claims the manager has to organize the drinks (today's special not organized as yet? It is now 8:20PM). Ten customers in here and yet we haven't received a drink. We got our appetizers but no drinks. This is laughable. The waitress was apologetic and told us that the manager normally assigns the specials for the later crowd at 9pm and onwards. We left at 9:09 there were 9 patrons in the restaurant. The delicious appetizers was delivered to our table in a timely manner. Chris ordered the Appleton Special which we were told was the third rum added to the special.

The curry sauce was a perfect blend of curry and Caribbean spices. \n\nThe Jerk Chicken Coconut Linguini was delicious, packed full of spicy jerk sauce that had layers of intense flavour.\n\n*The portions seemed a bit small and I wished the entrees came with some bread to soak up all the sauces. \n\n I highly recommend the rum cake which was rich, moist and packed with sweet rum flavour. The rum butter drizzle on top took me to cloud 9.\n\nThere's an extensive drink menu featuring various rums. \n\nService: our waiter was very attentive and friendly. We came on a weeknight for dinner and there were only a few tables occupied. \n\nAtmosphere: modern, chic, romantic\n\nFamily-Friendly: kids menu for $7 available, *although it would be better if the meals included some veg \n\nPrice:  This place is more upscale so menu prices are set a bit higher with appez around $11-15 and entrees around $20-30.

We went last friday,and it was pretty pitiful.  We were fairly frequent diners there, so we knew what our food should taste like.\n\nThe black pepper beef had NO garlic in it, and the sauce was so thin it pooled under the meat on the plate.  Each of us tried one bite and realized that the taste was off.  Not just the missing garlic, but the beef had a very strong, gamey taste.  I grew up in the country, and the first thing that came to mind was venison.  I quickly grabbed  my water and took a drink to see if the tallow formed in my mouth like it does when eating venison.  No tallow, but such a strong taste.  Not many people haven't eaten beef before, so we were quite sure that there was a problem with the beef or a mistake in our order.  We asked for a manager, and she really wasn't concerned at all.\n\nAdditionally, when the server came around to fill up our water glasses, the water in the pitcher was still very cloudy from being filled from the tap.  I realize that water is free and it is the same when it comes out of my tap, and I drink it.  It's just yucky when the appearance doesn't even seem to matter to the staff.\n\nIt is a bit puzzling that they would decide to use iPads for menus at almost the same time that they decided to ditch real linens and put butcher paper down.

The upside of this is that your food tends to come out at a good pace. However, it seems the servers in this particular location haven't quite grasped good service, and considering how small the restaurant is, it shouldn't be that difficult.\n\nWe always get the AYCE at Makimono, I have no idea why you wouldn't because its quite good value for your money. I was generally disappointed with the rolls at this location; haphazardly put together, not very tight and some rolls were a completely different size than at the other location! Some weren't even made the same! We can usually pound back about 12 spicy butterfish rolls but here, they were significantly larger and we had a very difficult time finishing them. I don't know if they get their fish from the same supplier but it just wasn't up to snuff. The sashimi was good, but some of the ingredients in the rolls just weren't as fresh and didn't taste as bright. \n\nAgain, the service left something to be desired and service is very important to me. Our server seemed to not care if we wanted to order more and while there were like three servers covering the whole restaurant, they seemed rather detached and working on autopilot. I noticed people walking in and the staff would tell them to sit wherever and then no one would approach the table. One table had to get up 5 minutes afterwards and ask for menus - the place is so small, they could have simply called it across the restaurant but you shouldn't have to do that regardless.\n\nOverall, while there's not a hell of a lot of difference between the locations, I'd travel the extra 15 minutes to the Pickering location to eat there rather than coming to this location.  Better quality rolls, faster service and better (albeit not much better) service.", "date": "2012-07-11 13:17:59"}

Sometimes I'll get the Mushrooms Neptune or Baked Garlic Shrimp.\n\nI don't think I've ever had a bad experience at The Keg regardless of the location, but if you are in the Ajax area this Keg is definitely worth going to.", "date": "2015-03-29 15:27:46"}

The best thing to order from them in my personal opinion is the Sultani kabob combo if you are a beef lover-the meat is tender and juicy and delicious! Their naan is always freshly made fluffy pillows of dough, and it might be weird to say that the salad is my favorite part of the combo, but they put so much effort into constructing every part of their dishes that you can tell they go the extra mile for the food to be just that more extra delicious! When it comes to deciding between this location and the competing kabob place off Brock, we still come here and have never been dissapointed! The staff is super friendly and accommodating and a very supportive family restaurant. They are really good for catering events too! Other notable things to order is the Tikka (any meat!)

I will try and approach my review differently, to let you know how to best use this place.  From there you can give it a shot and see what you think.  Fair?\n\nThe best night I recommend you give a try is on a Thursday to start.   You have 1/2 price Rum Cocktails on Thursdays from 6-8.   I have attached the menu.   I must say Carribean Restuarant or otherwise, they do a pretty good job of supplying an interesting Drink Menu.   They use a variety of Rums, and I say they make a good drink.  If you have a date, I recommend you try one of their Martini's - Caramel Martini, Pina Colada Martini, or if you want to clear your sinuses with a kick try a drink with some Ginger in it :) \n\nWhat makes Thursday a particularly good date night as well is half price apps (the wings do well, they have a good cajun dry rub).  If you make it to about 8:30, the specials are done, but they have Live Entertainment that I would describe as good, not over the top loud, just nice mellow vibe.  So, half price drinks, half price apps, and a calm vibe of Entertainment.\n\nThe other night to try is on a Saturday.   They have a consistent party every Saturday - RnB, Soca, Reggae.   DJ Smooth B and rotating DJs.  They have these nice huge heat lamps outside as a summer bonus.\n\nThere are many options across Toronto, but if you compare the effort, Rum Diaries compares well.  3 things to look for music, atmosphere, and drinks.  I strongly recommend you start with a Thursday first (take a date).   If you like what they are doing there (I do), check it out on a Saturday.\n\nWrite back here what you think.", "date": "2017-08-22 20:04:18"}

I tell her I'd rather have my own rainbow roll than somebody else's. \n\nYes, they replaced it. But it was a pale imitation of my fav. No tuna. One measly strip of salmon, a measly strip of white 'tuna' (ick) and lots of avocado. I just took down the luscious picture of their rainbow roll I posted about 3 years ago.

I needed tires for my car but am very specific about which tires I use. The place that I normally go to and totally trust cannot supply me with these tires. So I checked Yelp and found Tire Depot close to home. When I first called, I spoke with Craig. He was very helpful and told me there was no problem with getting these tires and the price was right. A couple of my colleagues heard me speaking with Craig and asked if they could get a quote as well. A 3 of us decided we would get our tires from him. Early next morning we all met there. My old summer tires (still on rims) were in the back of my friend's pickup truck, as I do not like to carry the tires in my car. We left 2 cars behind and I drove my friends to work. We would come back later that day to get my tires done. Later in the day, we went back. My car was taken inside and they changed the tires using a floor jack instead of a hoist as they didn't have one available but still wanted to accommodate me. We waited outside. My car came out but I noticed my tires in the back seat and trunk. I told them that the tires were to be put in the pickup truck. I went to get the tires and one of the guys said, he would move them for me. Not sure if there was a specific reason for this as you will find out. When I opened the back door, I saw that the tires were thrown on to my blazer (my work attire). It was good thing that I did not have my phone and glasses in there. I let it go everything else had gone well. \n\nWhen I got home, I went to put a few things (booster cables, blankets, windshield washer, etc., not a lot of stuff) back into the trunk. I noticed an object in the trunk. Now I know it was not there that morning as I had emptied the trunk. I was the magnet from my subwoofer. I called back the next day and spoke with Trevor and explained to him what happened. He told me to come in and that he would have a look. I went in that evening; he told me all he had to do was glue it back. I questioned this and was told they have done it before. I was to bring the car back and leave it for a day. I took the car back; keep in mind that I had to rearrange my schedule and also arrange for a ride there and back. That evening I went to pick up my car. Craig drove it out complimenting me on the car and condition. I thanked him but told him I want to hear the speaker. There was hardly any sound coming out of it. This is where it goes bad. He told me he didn't work on it. Didn't matter. They didn't even check their work. I told him that they had damaged my car and I needed it fixed. He told me the speaker was expensive and that the car is too old and he didn't know if the damage was there before I brought the car in.  Told him it didn't matter. The car is in great shape and I look after it. It has a Mark Levinson system that until this point was working fine. He went on a rant about a Tic Tac sized rust spot on the car and that Lexus has poorly designed the location of the sub and that he should not be held accountable. He had the nerve to ask if I was 16 years old, referring to the fact that I like to hear bass in my music. I was not going to have to flip the bill for this. He told me not to worry and that he would look after me by replacing it with another brand of speaker. I told him this was unacceptable, keep in mind, Trevor had told me if the gluing didn't work he would get me the same speaker. \n\nCraig told me he would look into and call me back. I heard from him a couple of days later and told me he had found the same speaker from a buddy and that I would have to leave the car for another day. Again I had to arrange a ride etc. I picked up the car that evening, Craig left the shop as I was testing the speaker. Well they installed a blown speaker that they got from what I assume was a scrap yard because of the yellow markings on it. I cannot even listen to the stereo anymore. \n\nI have not gone back nor will I. I will end up paying close to $1000 to get this fixed. I can't imagine the incompetent, condescending, and arrogant, people actually doing work on items likes brakes.

I first went to Markham Mazda and expressed an interest in leasing a Mazda .3. The woman who met with me did not shake my hand, did not offer to sit down with me. I believe it was close to the end of her shift and she was impatient to go home. I inquired about the recent graduate program and she told me I \"probably didn't qualify\" but made no effort to be friendly or accommodating. I left feeling as though my business didn't matter, perhaps because I look younger. \n\nI then went to a Hyundai dealership to check out an Elantra. The sales rep was short and rushed showing me an Elantra. \n\nOn a friend's recommendation, I took a trip out to Ajax. It was definitely worth the drive. The customer service I experienced there was exceptional. I did not feel pressured and my questions were met with patient and informative answers. Nathan, the lead finance manager there could not have been more professional, friendly and genuine. I don't know much about cars, and for someone making her first car lease/purchase, I greatly appreciated Nathan's respectful demeanor and knowledge of the industry. Not once did I feel as though my naivety was being \"taken advantage of\". Chris, the sales associate there, gave me a thorough run down of the car - unlike my experience at Hyundai. \n\nI left Ajax Mazda very happy and returned within 2 days to pick up my new Mazda 3, which I love. Within my first week I hear a rattling in the undercarriage. I took it back to be looked at and it was only a Rick that bounced up from the road and settled in a metal piece under the car. The service  team was efficient, professional and speedy. They even took the car for a complimentary car wash for me!\n\nI've never written a yelp review before, but my experience with Nathan and Chris and the Ajax Mazda team had to me shared", "date": "2016-08-01 21:04:47"}

Went for a groupon of 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and a dessert.  We went for a 6pm reservation on a Friday.  Had friendly and and helpful service that checked in on us occasionally in between courses.  Food arrived at a decent pace though it could have been quicker but nothing to complain about.  Food was amazing.  Everything was cooked perfectly and the jerk taste had a great kick without overwhelming you with spice or completely taking over the taste.  No complaints at all on any of the food.  Good rum selection of all kinds. Tried 2 cocktails which were good and expected.  Atmosphere is ok at this time but we were not there for music or anything like that so it was ok that there basic restaurant background noises.\n\nDetails.  Even though I live in Toronto I pass by Ajax every few months and saw a groupon for this caribbean dinner for two.  The restaurant and menu looked interesting enough so we decided to try it.  For $55 regular groupon price you get to choose 1 app, 2 entrees, and a dessert from this menu.\n\nAppetizers: jerk chicken, calamari, and banana rum mussels\nEntrees: chicken and waffles, jerk chicken linguine, veggie rundown, and jerk pork\nDesserts: rum br\u00fbl\u00e9e and golden rum cake\nThey also have an extensive rum selection including various cocktails made with rum and a small separate seasonal cocktails selection to choose from.  \n\nFinding the place in Ajax wasn't hard and they have plenty of parking.  At least for the time that we arrived for.  We've read reviews about the place about how bad service has been to big parties and how slow it could be when they were having their music playing late at night so we chose to come 6pm on Friday.  When we arrived there were a few tables that were  full but obviously and not gotten into their busy period yet.  We got a nice booth table from a very nice and attentive server who answered all of our questions without any disdain or even a hint of a grimace.   She took our orders and brought out the drinks first. \n\nWe ordered Tropical Fruit Spritzer and Pineapple Mai Tai. The tropical Fruit Spritzer tasted more of the guava and the rum and could have used more mango but was exactly what I had wanted to go with the food I was having which worked out great for me.  The pineapple Mai Tai my girlfriend ordered tasted like it sounded.  It was perfectly sweet and blended all the flavours perfectly and was what you expect when you order a Mai Tai.\n\nWe chose to get the Spiced calamari as our appetizer.  It was covered in a delicious marinade that was kept light and thin enough that it didn't taste overwhelming fried.  The jerk mayo that came with it complemented it perfectly and gave it the kick I wanted from jerk mayo.\n\nWe got the Jerk chicken coconut linguine and the Buttermilk chicken and waffles for our entrees.  The linguine was heavenly.  The sauce coated the linguine perfectly and hit you initially with a sweet creamy coconut feeling that melts you and then nails you with tangy kick from the jerk seasoning that just brings you back to the sweet creamyness that takes you in circles of deliciousness.  I am speaking as someone who doesn't even like coconut that I was still a huge fan of this dish and kept stealing bites from my girlfriends.  I got the chicken and waffles myself and may never be able to eat the dish so easily ever again.  These were the lightest waffles I have ever had.  Even though the waffle that came was your basic size from a waffle iron already split into quarters I picked up a piece and didn't even think I was holding a piece already.  The waffle was light and of course quite crispy on the bite but still contained waffle softness below it.  Not the softest I've had but it would be hard to have any more softness while keeping it that light.  The waffle itself was a good amount of sweetness and went really well with the maple syrup which they had also jerked.  The jerk taste in the syrup was not as strong as it had been in all the previous dishes mentioned and could be missed if you've been eating those dishes immediately before eating the syrup but went very well with the waffles and chicken themselves.  The chicken was so moist and tender and also fried light so that I could taste jerk chicken and did not taste oil and grease any more than if the chicken had been baked.  Even after tasking that heavenly linguine I don't regret choosing to eat the chicken and waffles except that I may regret not being able to eat this dish anywhere else without disappointment.\n\nWe chose the rum cake for our dessert.  The cake was strongly flavoured and matched very well with the ice cream which I assume was vanilla but I think was some variation of vanilla like french vanilla but not quite that.  They worked very well together and the cake went down great despite being full from all the food.  The cake was moist and on it's own was good if a touch heavy but went down real easily combined with the ice cream.\n\nDefinitely coming back here.", "date": "2018-04-25 01:13:43"}

We were deeply disappointed with the flavours.  After reading the reviews on here we were stoked - being lovers of Jamaican food for years.  In the end, what we thought would be phenomenal was just 'whatever'.  This leads me to ask the question, what the hell were all these reviewers going on and on about?  Seriously, I have been to countless Jamaican/West-Indian joints for Jerk, Roti, Curry, etc, and this place DID NOT stand head and shoulders above all the rest.  In the pool of Caribbean restaurants, this joint AT BEST is 3/5.  For reasons on WHY, read on.\n\nWhy, contrary to other reviewers, I found this place to be an average 3/5 stars:\n1)  They charge you almost a full dollar for gravy on your meal - 0.95 cents to be exact.  This is just unheard of.  I've been to Ritz's on Yonge, Cravin's, Mr. Jerk, Tastees, Caribbean Wave, and countless other restaurants along Eglinton Ave West (btwn oakwood and Allen) and I have never been charged for asking for gravy on my order.  To add insult to injury, the amount of gravy given was ridiculous and the rice and peas still tasted dry - now I know why one reviewer recommended the gravy.  THIS IS A HUGE MINUS 1 star.\n\n2)  The food can be evaluated in components:\na) Jerk Chicken - they serve more of a dry jerk chicken;  the flavour is on the outer skin of the meat and the marinade didn't really penetrate the meat on the inside; the flavour was subtle and you have to almost think about it in the after-taste to actually process the taste.  Better at so many other joints than this place.\nb) Jerk Pork - not bad...a bit on the dry side...nothing spectacular or praise worthy - in fact, if they couldn't do at least this much, I'd have deducted another star. \nc) Coleslaw - again, disappointing.  Lacked a cohesive flavour.  Good coleslaw allows the cabbage to soak up the other ingredients and become one in flavour...the coleslaw here tasted like the cabbage and the mayo had a fight and were trying to make the best of a relationship headed for disaster.  I tasted grated cabbage that was wearing mayo;  it wasn't 'coleslaw'.\nd) Rice and peas - good in terms of texture and firmness/softness, but again, it's freaking rice and peas man...if you can't make this to at least this level, you are not doing it right.  \n\nOverall, I think the people who buy from this place and put up these HIGH reviews are either: 1) ignorant of what really great west-indian/jamaican food is supposed to taste like or 2) they are related to the ownership/management of the restaurant. ;-)\n\nRecommendation:  Go if there is nowhere else for you to go.  But, I will not say this place is heavely, devine or magnificant.  Why?  Because it's not.  I won't follow the rest when the rest obviously don't know what they are talking about.  Personally, this place is easily forgotten and makes me think the reviewers of ajax west indian food really need to travel into the GTA core to sample what is probably a closer representation of the true flavours of west indies.\n\nPeace.", "date": "2014-11-29 22:49:28"}

It was between 12 noon and 1pm and there was not another soul in the place.  I understand Purple Bubble has been open for 2 months.  There are a few tables, but I'm guessing their business is mostly takeout.\n\nOrdered Shrimp Summer Rolls and Classic Pho to go.  Shrimp in rolls did not smell fresh. I only ate one roll and saved the other for next day, which did not do the shrimp any good. Rolls come in one piece (not cut in half which would be usual) and tend to fall apart if you are not careful.\n\nThere was little depth of flavour to the Pho broth, which was disappointing. When one orders pho to go, the noodles, and meat are always on the side as are the bean sprouts and basil, with the broth separate, for mixing just before serving; this gives an opportunity to heat the broth first if you can, and not have the meat overcooked. This was the first time I have ever ordered takeout Pho where all of the meat had already been cooked.\n\nThere is a small covered \"steam table\" with about 8 different dishes available with combo options of 1 main, 1 side, or 1 main and 2 sides. \"Mains\" are noodles or rice.\n\nNot sure I would return as I feel there are much better Pho options available in Ajax and Pickering: Red Kitchen, Pho Metro, and Pho Saigon.\n\nStaff were very nice and accommodating, asking what sauces I wanted with the rolls and whether I wanted the bean sprouts (for the Pho) cooked (no!) and if I wanted basil (always!)", "date": "2015-10-20 17:05:19"}

Here's my take:\n\nService (1/5): 1 of the 2 main reasons why I wouldn't come back. I knew we had to wait \"longer\" than usual, but good service would have warned us that we'd have to wait around 1 hour for food... We waited 50 minutes for pizza, 55 minutes for poutine. Sure our waitress was kind, and we were thanked for our patience, but it was too late at that point. We just wanted to get something in our stomach and leave.\n\nLarge Pino Special + Poutine (1.5/5): The 2nd reason why I wouldn't come back. You can read every other review about how cheesy and full of ingredients the pizza was. How the crust was great and overall for a mom and pop shop they did make good pizza... but that won't make up for the food poisoning my boyfriend and I paid for after the fact. We both thought it was something else, but after I brought home left overs for my family they also had to use the bathroom to get rid of what they ate. I figure it was because Pino's was understaffed and with an influx of orders they rushed and did not cook the pizza well enough. The Poutine was pretty standard, nothing much to say there. \n\nCost (3/5): $20 for a large pizza and $7 for poutine + tip. Not bad. It's not a chain, the servings were large and hearty, so I think it was fairly priced.\n\nAmbiance (3/5): It's a mom and pop shop! Don't expect anything fancy. However it's family friendly and clean. Can't really ask for more than that.\n\nOverall, besides some kind of food poisoning and horrendous wait time, the pizza wasn't that special. it was a nice change from chains like pizza pizza and pizza hut, but not special enough to come back for a second round. Sorry Pino's.", "date": "2016-09-07 15:23:48"}

So we made the drive to South Ajax to give them a try. While it wasn't the Cornwall pizza I grew up with. It was it's own.. great sauce, fresh toppings and it was very good overall. My daughter had a XS cheese pizza for like $5.31 (so cheap), and my wife and I split a Med (half Pino Special, half Meat Lovers). I was very pleasantly surprised. Very generous on the toppings, including cheese. We will most certainly be back, and want to try other menu items. They had a large number of specialty pizzas.

The Devil Chicken had more heat, so it all depends on what you prefer.\n\nHopefully the Oshawa location will start offering the Kothu Roti's soon, that is by far the best thing they have there, definitely going back for more!\n\n\n-----------\n\n\nFinally, a new restaurant has opened that put's the 'fun' into Indian cuisine.  Samosa Hut, a fast food Indian restaurant has arrived in Oshawa, offering both classic and fusion based menu items, and is also Halal.\n\nThe atmosphere is both clean and friendly.  A hot table welcomes you to all their offerings, along with a menu of build to order items.  Keeping in mind this is fast food oriented, some items are average or your typical fare.  However, some of their more fusion-like items are just awesome.  One item in particular is their Devil Chilli Chicken.  Hot and full of flavour, has to be the best Indian protein I've ever had.  Also enjoyed their Fusion Stir-Fried Noodle and Chili Stir-Fried Potatoes.\n\nAt the time of this writing, the restaurant just opened so not all features were available for review.  One in particular that I'm very interested in is their Kothu Roti dishes.  They have a number to choose from and are all based on shredded flatbread that has been stir-fried and mixed with various ingredients including egg, vegetables, spices and one of their proteins (chicken, goat).  All of this then topped with a fried egg.  Looking forward to trying this with the Devil Chilli Chicken as the protein.\n\nOverall, Samosa Hut is a welcome addition to North Oshawa.", "date": "2018-06-22 14:37:21"}

This would have definitely hit the spot.\n\nI had two slice of their small delivered to a friend's house. I enjoyed it so much it warranted an order of their namesake special in the medium the very next day. The crust is on the thin side, but is sturdy and does not fold. It has a nice texture with a good balance of give and a bit of crunch, able to support the toppings. Sauce is well immersed into the pie, without squirting or bleeding out on a bite and without the offending tartness of sauces on pizzas of lesser joints. But the CHEESE. If you don't like cheese, don't bother coming here. I suspect---but I could be wrong--- that there are two layers of cheese: one thin one to anneal the toppings to the pie and another thicker wave that is in direct exposure to the oven heat (leading to spots of caramelized cheese at the topmost layer). The result? A wonderful pie layered in both texture and flavour leading to a more dimensional mouthfeel. Really my only gripe with this pizza is the pepperoni--- I'm a sucker for curled in crispy pepperoni and that can only happen if the pepperoni is at the very top layer. Otherwise, Pizza Pino comes highly recommended.", "date": "2017-03-31 12:05:21"}

The regular crust is halfway between regular and deep dish. I am a crust and dough lover so it really appealed to me. The flavor of the dough was also great and not overpowered by the rest of the pizza. It was crisp around the edges and bottom and had a great soft chew throughout the rest.  The cheese could be a bit better quality but you can't argue with the amount that they put on. The toppings were also used in good amounts. I had the personal size XS which was under $10 with 3 toppings.  I ate the whole thing and I was STUFFED. The decor is very dated but I personally think that only adds to experience.

We were greeted and seated promptly by a very efficient young server who was also our pizza maker.  Since it was our first time, we decided to stick to something \"safe\" like a medium size pizza (Pino Special, I think) and a Caesar salad to share between the two of us.  \n\nWhat first came out was a huge mound of over-dressed romaine in store bought dressing with a very generous amount of house-made croutons and enough bacon bits (the real thing) to clog a grown man's artery!   To be fair, I have to mention that we were given an option of receiving our salad tossed or with the dressing on the side.  And since we opted for the salad to be tossed in the kitchen, we can't really complain about the dressing overload part.  But let me just say that my husband is a real bacon lover and even he proceeded to push extra bacon bits he couldn't consume to the side of his plate which by the end of our belly-busting meal, created a small tower.  The salad was so huge that by the time our pizza arrived, we were already pretty full.  \n\nAnd then the behemoth of a pizza was placed on our table.....and we just looked at each other and burst into laughter at the thickness of this thing.  We had read numerous reviews about pizza pino's pizza being thick crust but seriously....this was like having two regular pizzas (like what you'll get from pizza pizza) stacked on top of each other.  Again, not necessarily a bad thing for those wanting a hefty meal but for us, it was supposed to be lunch.  \n\nOur pizza was LOADED with pepperoni slices, mushrooms, even more bacon bits, I think there were some green peppers and soooooooooo much cheese.  I can't even begin to describe what this thing looked like.  (please refer to the photos)  I had ONE slice and could not dare grab another one.  My stout hubby had impressive TWO slices.  The shock of the thickness aside, the pizza was tasty.  How could it not be with that much goodness???  It's just a shame that we were so full from our salad.  We packed up the rest (more than half of the medium pizza) for dinner.  We ended up eating the leftovers over 2 meals!\n\nNow, the million dollar question is, would I return to Pizza Pino.  I think I might....that is if I could recruit enough heavy eaters to justify ordering a pizza that big (or that thick).", "date": "2012-09-19 15:58:34"}

I'm such a huge noodle soup lover and always on the lookout for a new joint to call my new go-to place for Pho.  After reading reviews for the Red Kitchen, I thought maybe this could be the one.  Sigh...\n\nWe ordered a rare beef pho lunch special which comes with 2 mini (they're really mini) and a choice of coffee or tea and a bowl of bun bo hue.  I've been a fan of bun bo hue ever since I first tasted it in Pho Metro (scarborough) and have tried this delectable soup in many other Vietnamese joints and I'm sad to say, this one was the most dumbed down version of this glorious soup I love so much. \n\nThe broth for the rare beef pho was so bland and lacked beefiness umami.  The meat was ok, I think.  I was too busy digging into my own bowl of spicy (well, it was supposed to be) bun bo hue.  As far as the lunch special rare beef pho is concerned, I don't think I'd order it again.  \n\nBun bo hue suffered similar fate as the rare beef pho but with more transgressions made against such a signature dish.  First of all, they had the wrong noodles for this soup.  They served the same rice noodles that was in the pho, not the thick round noodles bun bo hue is supposed to have.  From there on, it was a lack of a whole bunch of ingredients (shredded red cabbage, onion, Vietnamese bologna, blood jello...etc) that made this dish so disappointing.  The broth didn't taste enough of the lemongrass or the sweet/salty/sour balance or even the beef.  There was a good amount of brisket and rare beef but asides from that, there was nothing else.  Literally....\n\nI'm sad to say that the Red Kitchen did not impress me.  I'm willing to give it another shot and try something else but it won't be any time soon.  \n\nNext stop, the Pho Metro in Ajax!", "date": "2015-01-07 17:23:59"}

Don't waste your time reading those arrogant snobs on certain other websites (whose moderators would probably delete this review), just go directly to the Durham Centre in Ajax and go to Five Guys. \n\nUntil this New Jersey import came along, the selection in Pickering and Ajax was weak at best.  Lots of \"meatloaf\" style burgers (yuck), the over-rated New York Fries-owned garbage across the street called South St. Burger, etc.   Time for the Americans to take the local yokels to school.\n\nIf you've never been, note that a regular hamburger or cheeseburger is a DOUBLE, while the little hamburger/cheeseburger is a SINGLE.    Unlike a lot of other places out there, toppings are free at Five Guys (other than cheese or bacon).  Grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, jalapeno peppers... too many places charge for these.  Not here!\n\nI like to order a cheeseburger and have it \"all the way\" plus jalapeno peppers.  Perfect combination, but even with all those extras, the freshness and the flavour of the beef still comes through.   Fries are amazing -  they're cut in-house, never frozen, fried in peanut oil* and they always dump in more than you order.  We ordered \"regular\" fries, there was a box with the fries in it, and as many fries that were in the box, scattered on the bottom of the bag!!    \n\nAnother tip - always check the whiteboard on the wall near the cash registers, which tells you which farm the potatoes being used for today's fries came from.  In Canadian locations, more often than not you'll see Cavendish Farms, PEI up there - same generic taters as you can buy at any Loblaws. But if you see an IDAHO farm listed, you're in for a treat.  I find Idaho potatoes much more flavorful than the bland varieties out of PEI, New Brunswick, or Ontario.

Thankfully when it arrived, it was clear that it had been freshly poured.\n\nWe both ordered off the express lunch menu, my dad got pulled pork and I got a turkey, apple, cranberry, bacon wrap thing. My dad really enjoyed his sandwich and cleaned his plate. My wrap was okay but it didn't really fit together and there was too much mayo. Wraps are normally fool proof but this one fell short for me.\n\nOnce we had finished we were chatting (not in a rush) but it took at least 10-15 minutes for our plates to be cleared an the MOD (manager on duty) walked by us a number of times.

Don't waste your time reading those arrogant snobs on certain other websites (whose moderators would probably delete this review), just go directly to the Durham Centre in Ajax and go to Five Guys.  Finally they made it here; until this location opened I had to go to west Scarborough or to Oshawa.   \n\nUntil this New Jersey import came along, the selection in Pickering and Ajax was weak at best.  Lots of \"meatloaf\" style burgers (yuck), the over-rated New York Fries-owned garbage across the street called South St. Burger, etc.   Time for the Americans to take the local yokels to school.\n\nIf you've never been, note that a regular hamburger or cheeseburger is a DOUBLE, while the little hamburger/cheeseburger is a SINGLE.    Unlike a lot of other places out there, toppings are free at Five Guys (other than cheese or bacon).  Grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, jalapeno peppers... too many places charge for these.  Not here!\n\nPersonally I like to order a cheeseburger and have it \"all the way\" plus jalapeno peppers.  Perfect combination, but even with all those extras, the freshness and the flavour of the beef still comes through.   Fries are amazing -  they're cut in-house, never frozen, fried in peanut oil* and they always dump in more than you order.  We ordered \"regular\" fries, there was a box with the fries in it, and as many fries that were in the box, scattered on the bottom of the bag!!    \n\nThe restaurant isn't easy to see from the street as the storefront faces into the \"courtyard\".  Just go into the Costco parking lot then look over to the building which has the Black's Camera shop at the end.  Five Guys is between the Black's and the George Richards. They're open daily 11am-10pm.\n\n* peanut allergy sufferers, don't bother.

The cleanliness leaves something to be desired and the staff are just a bunch of kids who have no skills or concept of customer service.\nBut my review is about the CMAC Ajax Dojo that teaches karate out of this one and only location. In general the class is good. The children's classes are full and the kids seem to enjoy it. Don't expect the Sensei to help your kid. He just sits there and tells you what to do, never gives clear demonstrations so when a new person joins they are left floundering and relying on the person next to then to learn the kata's. \nIt is also important to understand that favoritism is an issue in this dojo. The dojo has rules which the sensei will tell you are like the 10 commandments and must be obeyed, yet being the hypocrite he is, he ignores those rules for certain members in the dojo (his GF and her kid). This makes for a very negative and uncomfortable feeling in the dojo. We have taken our karate practice to another dojo.", "date": "2016-01-09 12:02:21"}

We went once or twice a week. The food was good and the prices of the specials was decent. Honestly, though, I did not always look at the bill as closely as I should.\n\nI realized that despite the fact that an all-day breakfast is advertised as $5.99 on the sign that is outside the restaurant, I was being charged more. I was being charged $6.99 for breakfast AND I was charged $1.49 extra for coffee. The sign, as you can see for yourself, is 3 eggs, bacon/ham/sausage, homefries, toast & tea/coffee for $5.99. No time restrictions.\n\nMy $5.99 breakfast was costing me $8.48!\n\nSo the next time we went in, I drew this to their attention. They said that was before 11:00 am. (This happened in the afternoon. Their menu has an every day breakfast item for $5.99, before noon) I demanded that they honour their advertising. Staff check with manager and they said they would do it this time. When the bill came, I was charged $5.99 for the breakfasts, plus charged extra for coffee.\n\nI went in a few days ago. I asked for the all-day breakfast advertised on the sign. I was told that they let us have it last time, but that was it. No more. I told staff that I was leaving unless they honoured the price. They refused. I was given a whole song-and-dance explanation about how they have been informing all of their customers about the increasing price of bacon and tomatoes, blah, blah, blah. I told them they could solve the problem by removing the sign. No, they said, it's the only sign they have - they can't remove it! \n\nA) It's not the only sign they have.\nB) That sign is advertising only one thing - and it's something they won't sell you.\n\nThree days later now - the sign is still there. BTW, this is not some permanent kind of sign. It's a sandwich board that keeps getting blown over in the wind and they keep putting it back up.\n\nI told them that I would spread the word about this. They said that they hoped that I wouldn't.\n\nThis business draws people in with false advertising. Their most prominently-advertised feature is something that you can't get there. If you order it, they will overcharge you.\n\nPlease don't support this dishonest and untrustworthy business.", "date": "2017-02-27 14:56:15"}

Our first night was stellar. We had terrific service and had such a hard time deciding on what to eat! We settled on a small order of poutine, a bowl of seafood chowder and a beet salad - all to share. I have to say that seafood chowder was probably the best I've ever had. Rich, creamy, packed full of sweet seafood - yummy to the last drop. It was so good, we had to go back the second night for a re-match. We opted to not only chow down on the chowder but also sample the seafood pie. This is where it all went downhill. The chowder was okay, but the seafood pie was not at all what I expected. The seafood was bland; the sauce was liquid and runny with no flavor at all and the pastry was tough. I sent it back and while the management comped the meal, I was really surprised that no one - the server or the manager - asked if they could bring me something else! I thought that strange. And I was a little tiffed, too, because I was hungry. So I guess my final decision on MacCool's is it's just okay. You may get lucky with what you order or you may end up leaving hungry like I did.

It has actually ruined the burger experience for me at other restaurants now because all other burgers taste sub par compared to Five Guys. The only other burger place that I feel was as good was Shake Shack in New York.  I think it is the American Cheese that I love so much. I had to give my complements to the manager at the time.

I had heard a lot of great things about her as a colorist and unfortunately, due to the unprofessional nature of this salon, I was unable to have my appointment for either cut or colour.\n\nI rushed from Toronto to make it for my appointment Friday, Sep 28th at 630 pm. Since I didn't receive any sort of call verifying my appointment, I called to confirm around 2 PM on that day and they told me everything was still scheduled. They apologized for not calling to confirm and asked if this was my first time, in which I said yes. They then asked if I had had a consultation in which I said no since no one had told me I needed one. I also asked at this time who my stylist was, and when they mentioned it would be a new stylist, I had asked if it was possible to get a more experienced stylist or if Ruby was available by any chance to do the cut (since she was already doing my colour). I got there early at around 530, again to mention that I would much rather have a bit more of an experienced stylist since I was doing something a bit more drastic with my cut and that this was my first time. They reassured me that it would I would be fine with stylist who I was originally scheduled to work with. They mentioned there was no one else so I wasn't going to argue and said I would be back for my regular app time at 630. Upon returning, I was greeted with Ruby telling me that unfortunately she had fallen behind and that she not only couldn't do my colour, but no one could do my cut either. She suggested me coming back for a cut only at 730 (an hour later) or the next morning at 830 am (for again, cut only) and then schedule colour for another time. I'm sorry but people have other things scheduled on their weekends and can't just be available at any time because of they've now been inconvenienced.   \n\nLet me start by saying, I'm not here to blame the stylists. Ruby was apologetic and tried to accommodate but given the fact that I booked this a month prior, that I left downtown early to get there, that I was going to a wedding on the Sunday and needed my hair done - this was a completely unprofessional. I even called myself to confirm a couple hours prior and arrived there an hour earlier to chat about what I wanted. If there was an issue with lack of communication with the receptionist or lack of staff, this was a problem that should have been addressed beforehand. \n\nWith this being said, I was looking forward to working with Ruby and trying this salon for the first time but unfortunately, they have lost my business over this.\n\nI also messaged them to ask the owner to reach out in regards to this and I never received a call so I've now had to leave this review instead.\n\nMy advice to anyone else - call multiple times to confirm your appointment, make sure they schedule a consultation if it's your first time, be clear in expressing what you want done or else they'll schedule you for less time than you actually need and then not have time to take your appointment at all - or better yet, just go somewhere else. \n\nOverall a huge disappointment.", "date": "2018-10-02 21:28:01"}

My wife's salad had field greens, the other lady had a bed of ICEBERG LETTUCE!  There was supposed to be goat cheese. My wife's had a reasonable amount of it but the other lady's had about 2-3 small crumbs of it. We had enough. We called for the manager (but there was none around of course!!) Some poor woman probably got volunteered to be the manager of the evening and she trundled out to apologize for the service and the food.

Pizza Pino is a treasure that my friends and I came across while visiting another friend in Ajax. They serve pizza, pasta, salad, yummy fried goodness, all the good stuff. You can add a variety of toppings but they have set prices for set toppings, such as the meat lovers, or veggie pizza. Their pizza is similar to Chicago pizza for those who've tried, but thinner crust.\n\nThe thing I love about this place is how fresh their toppings are; the chicken chunks are huge and tender, unlike other franchise pizza joints that have meats as hard as wood. And for the cheese lovers, you don't even have to worry about getting extra cheese because the amount of cheese you get on your pizza is ridiculously thick. Pino definitely does not cheap out on their toppings. \n\nWe ordered a large that on their website claimed to feed 3-4 people, but even with four hungry stomachs there were at least a quarter left of the pizza by the end of our feast. I'd say a large easily feeds 4-5! I ordered a medium on my own, and that alone was more than enough for my family of four for dinner!\n\nIt's pricey though, and that large pizza came up to $40, the medium $20. Granted, we customized our own pizza so it went by a different price. There was also a 45 minute wait on delivery, where it usually takes half the time (or so I'm told) so be prepared to wait for your food! Or call in ahead of time.

Just a tad bit more expensive than other places but the food this place offers makes up for that with strong flavours, and generous portions.\n\nOn my first visit, I was greeted by the owner of the joint (such a friendly fellow!) who allowed my friend and I to sample some of the meats before ordering. As we tried them, he kindly explained the flavour profiles of each meat and which he would recommend for each of us depending on what flavours we typically look for. \n\nTheir spicy devilled chilli chicken was a winner for me. As a person who likes to eat everything spicy, the name had already sold it for me but the unique combination of pepper flavours and spices that shine through in this chicken were what made my decision to settle for this one.\nTheir butter chicken had a unique flavour that is unlike other butter chicken dishes I've had from other places. Super creamy with a slight sweetness. This meat placed second on my list.\nThird was the spicy mutton. Typical mutton curry flavours were found in this one. Just a bit of a kick, not satisfying enough for my palette but was still pretty good!\nWe couldn't sample the jerk tamarind chicken leg. The guy said he wouldn't hack away at a leg for us to try!. He did, however, scoop some of its sauce into a sampling cup for us to try though. The sweet and sour tamarind flavours were really strong in this one, outshining any other flavours. Delicious, but not my thing.\n\nI settled for the spicy devilled chilli chicken kothu roti as I had been highly recommended it. On the side, I had ordered 12 of their signature samosas for $10. I got one of each of most of their signature flavours.\n\nThe devilled chilli chicken kothu roti was packed tightly into a round tin container with a generous amount of devilled chilli chicken, LARGE chunks of it! Yes! A slice of lime was also wedged in there and when squeezed over the kothu roti, compliments the dish well with a slight tang. The only downside to this dish is the wait time. The owner had warned me that it'd take some time to make. Seems like they make everything fresh to order. I waited about 25 minutes for it to be ready.\n\nOut of their signature samosa flavours, favourites that I MUST get again include: jerk chicken, devilled chilli chicken, curry chicken, spicy minced lamb, butter chicken, and spinach and sweet cream cheese. Jerk chicken samosa is a MUST GET. One of the best samosa flavours I've had... EVER. The spinach and sweet cream cheese samosa (although the filling seemed to have bled out while baking/frying) was super sweet; I'd consider it a dessert samosa. The samosas served here have a light flaky exterior that covers a thin bready wrapping for the fillings. Each samosa is generously packed with its delicious and flavourful minced fillings. \n\nMy friend had ordered a two meat + basmati rice carnivore combo ($9.99) with the butter chicken and the spicy devilled chilli chicken. She had asked the owner to not be shy with the sauce. He did NOT disappoint. The rice is basically bleeding the sauce. Delicious!", "date": "2018-04-14 15:52:17"}

Samosa Hut nailed it. I noticed a non-stop rush of customers coming in while I was there.\n\nThe restaurant is small as it is mostly meant for take-out and catering. However they do have a small table facing the entire side with the windows.\n\nThe food is displayed very nicely and organized. One section is the curries with the vegetarian options placed together, then the meat options. The other side is fried food items like samosas and rolls. There are clear and coloured name tags for each food item so you won't be confused. There are also the spicy levels (light orange, orange and red - for the least spicy to spiciest) under the food name.\n\nYou order your choice of food, and then pay at the end. Upon arriving at the outside of the restaurant, I saw 3 large posters of specials: Omnivore Combos, Carnivore Combos, and Vegan Combos. The names were very cute and drew my attention to the posters. These posters were also on the inside of the restaurant as well. The prices were very reasonable as you can get a rice combo for as low as $4.99 for lunch. We opted for the 1 meat + 1 veggie + basmati rice for $5.99 and the 4 veggie + basmati rice combo for $6.99.  \n\nFor the meat, we tried the spicy deviled chicken (very hot), and the veggie options we tried the sweet eggplant, sweet and spicy mango curry, spicy tomato and potato curry, and the Channa Masala (chickpeas). Warning to people who can't eat spicy not to order the spicy deviled chicken. It is VERY spicy but the flavour is good. The mango curry is tasty if you're going for something tangy. The spicy tomato and potato curry was okay. I found that the flavour was very interesting. The sweet eggplant and the Channa Masala were my favourite. The eggplant was sweet, as the name says, and the chickpeas were soft. \n\nI also ordered the butter chicken samosas (since it's their specialty) and the lamb samosas. As well as the fish roll. The samosas were very delicious and had a lot of filling inside. For the fish rolls, it was filled with potato and you can taste the fish flakiness so you know it's good stuff. \n\nLet me start off by saying that the portions were VERY generous. The staff in charge of scooping the food was friendly and gave thorough suggestions when I asked for his recommendation. I tried the Channa Masala (chickpeas) that he recommended and I did not regret it. it was amazingly delicious! \n\nI do have to say that most of their foods are mild/spicy so be prepared. I will be back and definitely recommend this place to anyone unsure of what to eat when they're in the Ajax area!", "date": "2016-10-24 18:21:34"}

I loved the pizza and the pino sticks were not bad nothing super special. I find the pino sticks had too much garlic on the top. Now the pizza was amazing, it wasn't as thick as other pictures posted but maybe that is because I got the garlic based pizza. I had pizza once at chucky cheese and liked how it had a garlic base so when I seen these guys offered it I had to try it out. Definitely awesome and adds more flavor to the pizza while not being over powering the toppings. I just had a 2 cheese and pepporoni and I could still them both. So A+ on the pizza!!!\n\nNow it was $30 for a medium pizza and sticks so not too bad and well worth the extra little cost. I will definitely order from them again.

There have been a handful of times when my tapioca has come to me still frozen/tough, and sometimes the flavour of the teas vary depending on which staff member is making it. On that note, they could use better customer service. Orders are typically about a 5 minute wait, but sometimes longer.  The staff are a bit less efficient than other bubble tea places I've been to in the Scarborough/Markham/downtown areas. Some of the staff do not appear confident with order taking/preparing the teas, but they are all very friendly and produce good teas pretty much all of the time. Everything that comes out of their kitchen has been consistently delicious also. I've tried their pho, Vietnamese noodle bowls, and hot take out - all of which are pretty fresh and authentic tasting. Adding Vietnamese food and some dessert to the menu was definitely a smart choice. It gives the restaurant a social, hangout dine-in appeal. Whoever is in the kitchen knows what they are doing. The ambiance has a homey, mom-and-pop shop feel. It is cozy enough, but modern decor would add to the experience for sure. Though they are going up against tough competition - Gong Cha, Chatime, Real Fruit, TenRen, Go for Tea, etc further to the West, Purple Bubble puts up a good fight and is great for satisfying any East-ender's bubble tea cravings.", "date": "2017-08-31 19:44:40"}

Then she left me at the drying station, packed her bag and left the store! No one came to me to tell me I was all done, no one asked if I was satisfied with the service. What a joke!

I had skin hanging off my fingers, extra acrylic spilling over, empty gaps near my cuticles, under my nails and BUBBLES forming inside the acrylic. His reaction was unprofessional. He scoffed at me and said that the nails are supposed to take 20min and it was a good job! He said that taking off the skin (that was hanging from all my nails was an extra 10$ and offered to cut them off himself!

Even at lunch time, it is not busy.  Great, because the one in Scarborough is a bit of a zoo.\n\nIf you haven't been to Five Guys before, here's the deal.  The patties are allegedly fresh and never frozen, and I think this is true, because their raw patties are bright red.  Also, they are griddled burgers--not char broiled.  There is a huge difference here.  Griddled burgers are cooked on a flat top, kind of like breakfast, and it cooks in its own fat.  If done right, as they do here, it should have a nice \"crust\" outside, and it should be juicer than char broiled.  What you lose, of course, are the grill marks and the smell of fat drippings hitting the heating element and smoking back up.  It is a matter of preference on which is better.  Five Guys makes some of the best griddled burgers though.\n\nFive Guys takes special pride in their fries.  I think they are a bit dry.  Too much starch has been removed, in my opinion.. thought that wouldn't be possible, but it is true here.  Their cajun fries are not good.  It is something that they sprinkle on afterwards, not while frying.  It is the typical cajun seasoning that you can buy at grocery stores (paprika, oregano, cayenne, cumin, etc).\n\nSome things to keep in mind while ordering:\n\n1.  Little = 1 Patty,  Regular = 2 Patties\n2.  Regular Fries = Feeds 2,  Large = Feeds 3-4\n3.  There is no discount for getting a \"combo\".\n\nA cheese burger combo will hit you up nearly 15 bucks after taxes.  Yikes.

Don't they have any concerns about allergies?\n\nThe burger tasted pretty decent, albeit a bit greasy. The fries were nicely seasoned but a little soggy (greasy). There's a reason they stuff a handful of napkins in the bag. Unless you really LOVE potatoes, there's probably no need to order more than a small sized fries. The serving was generous. Considering the amount of fries, unlimited toppings at no extra charge, and free drink refills, it doesn't seem as expensive anymore.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the crew of this location worked like a well oiled (pardon the pun) machine!

So after much debate, we decided to go back.\nWe were seated and I showed the manager on duty the email as instructed. Shortly thereafter the owner came to our table, introduced himself, then started to talk about how he thought my experience was from recently not from Aug/Sept...I'm not sure what this had to do with anything, but both my room mate and I felt uncomfortable that he felt the need to start a discussion about this...a bad experience is a bad experience. The owner then left the conversation with \"Don't worry, I'll take care of the bill\"...which really has one straightforward meaning.\nThe food was great, service was fine, nothing spectacular, then at the end of the meal (2 apps, 1 main each), the waitress asked us if we wanted her to bring the bill (I felt very awkward that our server was not advised of any adjustments with the bill and that I had to bring this to her attention)...I responded by telling her that the manager had advised that he was covering our bill. Our server returned a moment later with \"here's your bill\" and to our shock, she then explained that the owner had covered \"my meal\" which consisted only of my main...not my app and certainly not what he had set an expectation for. \nNeedless to say, we will not be returning to this location again. Had an expectation not have been set of \"taking care of our bill\", this could have been a very different experience; had the owner said that he was covering my main, we would have been informed and known what to expect, however this was not the case and considering this was an opportunity to make up on an already poor experience, we certainly didn't leave happy.", "date": "2016-01-04 03:15:12"}

It was my first time trying out this mediterranean chain of restaurants.\n\nWe both decided to get the ever so popular chicken shawarma. I got the chicken on the rocks with half greek salad which is chicken shawarma on top of rice topped with Osmow's famous sauce.\nI got the medium size and it was an ample amount of food. The greek salad was dressed in a tangy lemony vinaigrette which I really enjoyed. The rice was soft, fluffy, and buttery and the perfect base for the well seasoned chicken shawarma. The meat was a good mix of crispy pieces and juicy meat and coated in the Osmow sauce. I felt the sauce was a little heavy on the mayo side and it could of been more garlicky. Also they have a heat level which you can pick from for the amount of hot sauce you want on your food. The cashier warned us it was very spicy so I got \"a little bit spicy\" but I felt I could of gone up 1 or 2 more levels as it wasn't spicy enough for me but I can handle heat well.\n\nHubby got the half / half chicken which is chicken shawarma on top of half rice and half fries and topped with Osmow's famous sauce. Hubby also got the medium size which was also very filling for him. He thought the heat level of a little bit spicy was spot on for him and he loved the osmow sauce. His fries were made to order and he ate them all first and I was too caught up in my own meal to get to steal one but he said they were pretty tasty. His food was also a perfect split of fries and rice.\n\nThere are a few tables if you want to dine in but most people were coming for take out. All the staff here were pretty new and some were still being trained. The cashier took a while to punch in our order as he is still getting the hang of using the register system and our food took about 10 minutes to prepare but it was flavourful and hot.

Stay away from this place. Original owner was much better. \n\nTerrible experiences here. My boyfriend bought his truck here because his parents have been coming to Kelly and Sons for years. \nHe bought the truck under the promise that if there were issues with the truck, they'd help repair it. First lie. The truck sat on the driveway for 8 months barely used, because my boyfriend was in school. When he did start using the truck there were problems. Kelly & Sons insisted too much time had passed even though the mileage reading on the truck hadn't changed much from when he bought it. He had to pay $1,500 to get it running again. Then a few months later he had to pay $800 for repairs.\nA side of the truck had a chunk of it randomly fall off. When we called to get it fixed we were told too much time had passed. No effort made to try to help us in any way. \nThe truck now recently slammed to a halt and wouldn't move. Had to have it towed to Kelly & Sons. Sure enough $2,000 to get it running. They quoted him an additional $1,000 for a tire and rim. They also mentioned other work that needs to be done. We've had the truck less than 2 years (not driven for 8 months) and spent $4,300 in repairs when he paid $6,000. Rip off!!!!\nWe went to master mechanic and showed Eric the bill. He said he could of saved us $500. We asked about the other repairs. He said they don't need to be done. (It's a work truck). We asked about the tire and rim. He said tires were bald and should get new ones (which we knew) but he said the rim was fine. \nKelly and Sons seriously ripped us off and lost long time customers. I strongly suggest staying away from there.\nUpdate: FALSE!!!! The business owner replied to my comment and it is false! The owner of the vehicle didn't have a drivers licence. The truck sat on the driveway. That is exactly why we were angry that the truck is falling apart, because it WASNT being driven! Had the vehicle been used for snow removal and construction like he alleges that would be another story. I'm not an idiot and know cars require maintenance. When a truck sat unused for months and is breaking down, is when customers have a right to be angry.  I'd be more than happy to go to a DMV with the owner and show him that the owner didn't have a licence therefore wasn't driving or using the truck for work.", "date": "2018-02-02 01:42:19"}

The temperature of the gravy could be a little higher as it felt as if the poutine I was eating had been sitting out for a while , it wasn't hot but nonetheless it was good. The presentation of the burger was very simple yet appealing with the little toothpick that says come to big mammas house . The burger received no complaints I went for the classic burger which very good, the beef party was juicy and good in size. I ordered the brisket Ribs, they were Korean short rib style. The meat quality was better than expected, I would say AA or higher, but that comes at a cost for around 15 dollars you receive a pound a half which is a good lunch size portion but for dinner the two pounds would be recommended. The ribs were complimented with the smoked spicy BBQ, the taste was rich and almost overpowering at times, but great flavor.

Our food started to show up at our table at 1:50pm and I had to send my plate back because they didn't know how to cook cr\u00eapes and gave me pancakes instead. On top of that they actually had the gull to charge me $9 + (half off) for pancakes that I never ate because they were crap and I ordered cr\u00eapes. I asked everyone else at my table how they found the food. Nobody enjoyed their meal, they screwed up 95% of our orders, poached eggs, Sunnyside up, over medium, they just made scrambled eggs. This place actually charges $8 to $15 for breakfast meals that is crap. Not only is the food crap but for the money you pay, the food portions are very small. So thankfully the food is crap because there is less of it to eat. I don't usually say this as this is the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant, i felt sorry for the lady running this place.

We got out of this place at 2:30pm. 11am to 2:30pm it took about 3 hours to get our food. Its almost like they don't provide same day service.

But I have to say the calamari was probably the only decent thing about this night. We got our food shortly after. I ordered the goat cheese ravioli with smoked salmon. I'm 99% sure that there was little to no goat cheese in my ravioli as it had the taste and texture of ricotta cheese...something you'd pick up frozen at the grocery store. I also had to search for any pieces of smoked salmon as they were miniscule and few and far between. Overall, I've had store bought pasta much better than that. My boyfriend ordered the New York striploin which was supposed to come with tempura onion rings...there were none to be seen. The cut of the steak was completely wrong and the whole middle of the steak was all gristle. He also asked for sauce on the side and his steak was completely coated in it.

We had a coupon for the restaurant which is another reason why we decided to try it, and both waitresses tried to short change us on the value of it, finally after telling them 3 times what needed to be done, they got it right.The service here was atrocious, the food was seriously lacking, especially for the price, the atmosphere was alright however it was freezing because it was cold and drafty.I'd never waste my time going here again and would warn other people about going there.

They had all sorts of people here: large groups, intimate couples, families with small children, families with teens, elderly couples, middle aged, and teenagers you name they had it.\n\nI checked in with the hostess and she told us it would be a 10 minute. Truly I didn't believe her but sure enough at the 10 minute mark she came over and led us to a large leather booth with a tv in the middle airing the Jays game. The restaurant is a bit a dated and surely has seen better days but it definitely had a lively upbeat atmosphere.\n\nOur waitress came over and introduced herself and went over the specials for the day. Every week they have an additional menu of specials, I noted one of the specials of the day was an 8oz baseball steak and lobster for only $23 bucks! However I was more in the mood for some greasy food.\n\nThankfully our friendly waitress was very educated on the menu, she was so informative as I was torn between 3 entrees and she was soo good in helping me make a final decision.\n\nDeli Reuben Sandwich- Shaved corned beef topped with sauerkraut, Russian dressing, Swiss cheese grilled to perfection on light rye bread\nStacked high with ample meat layered with that tangy kraut and a light coating of creamy Russian dressing with perfectly melted cheese held together with crispy toasted buttery rye it was perfectly done! Served with mustard on the side for good measure I adored this sandwich!\nOh and lets not forget about the side. I went with the onion rings. They were out of this world good! Thick cut super crispy golden exterior enclosing that tender sweet onion! Yum!\nI can't believe how good they did two traditional items. I was quite impressed!\n\nOverall I have to say I will definitely be returning to this spot! Great food with wide variety of items, friendly and attentive staff, and very affordable prices.

Meeting at my storage facility, Emilie gave me lots of great info and made clear that she wanted the business, and would give me the most competitive quote possible.\n\nCompared to the other candidates, well, she was just brilliant, so I agreed to give them the business.  They went, packed up everything, and brought it all here, and the service was basically perfect.  They made a complicated process pretty simple, and for that I'm happy to recommend them.", "date": "2011-05-03 17:52:56"}

So on a whim after a long day Hubby and I decided to quickly pop in before heading home.\nUpon entering aromas of sweet milk chocolate began filling your senses. At 6pm on a Saturday evening it was starting to get quite busy. There is a case of handmade chocolate truffles and off in the distance I see the chocolate dipping station and a soft serve machine. They also offer tons of packaged chocolates, canned fondues, chocolate lollipops, and some cooking utensils.\nFor those who are unfamiliar with this Quebec based chain it is an artisinal chocolate shop whose speciality is selling soft serve ice cream that is hand dipped in 1 of 12 real chocolate flavoured dips. They also have milkshakes, gourmet hot chocolates, and soft serve icecream on a waffle or brownie.\nAlthough we had already had a huge dinner and dessert how could I turn down trying that famous dipped ice cream. They have quite a bit of seating here if you want to stay and enjoy your dessert however we got everything to go. They offer a variety of sizes but I went with the smallest size called \"baby\". They had only 2 flavours of soft serve that night vanilla and orange so I got a vanilla dipped in dark chocolate.\nThe baby size was actually a perfect amount for me considering I just wanted a little something. The soft serve itself isn't anything to write home about just your typical vanilla. However the real highlight here was the quality of the dip. The chocolate used was delicious! The dip was quite thick and rich and for dark chocolate it was on the sweeter side almost more semi sweet tasting to me. However the coating was really hard and I had a tough time biting through it. I was glad I asked for in a cup because If I was biting a cone I could see it shattering everywhere however I still had a heck of time cracking through the chocolate coating to get to the ice cream especially with my plastic spoon. The chocolate also solidified to the cup and although it was mighty tasty I hard time chiseling it off the cup.\nHubby got a small Strawberry Shortcake Milkshake. He said it was good but he wasn't wowed by it.\nOverall I have to say there chocolate is on point. It's an interesting concept of a shop and something different to have around. I'll be back to try out some of there chocolates and if the craving hits again I wouldn't mind to try a different flavoured dip soft serve or perhaps the brownie or waffle topped ice cream.", "date": "2018-02-18 02:44:56"}

Oh, and if you like your bacon crispy, then Retro does it just right....there's nothing quite like a little bacon cheeseburger to brighten your day :) Amirite?\n\nAnyway, this is just a simple, no-frills burger cafe so don't expect anything fancy or gourmet....just expect one helluva tasty, \"that-hit-the-spot\" burger.

When I asked them about it (I hadn't even told them my name or prescription yet at the pick-up counter) they said \"oh yes it's going through now, yeah, it's covered\". How were they able to suddenly have it go through my insurance without knowing any of my information, including my name? The woman didnt even ask for any of my info to check if I was covered or not, she just printed out a new receipt with the proper price. They were clearly trying to charge me full price on something I was covered for hoping I wouldn't notice, and waiting to be called out before charging the correct, lower price. \n\nA few months later on the same prescription, they suddenly started charging me full price again, despite me telling them I'm covered and have been covered on it for years. The technician was arguing with me, saying that I didn't have insurance. I had to give my info again, and it turned out I was actually covered 100%, but if it was up to them I would've been paying over $50 for it. \n\nAlways double check that they are charging you the correct price under your health coverage, otherwise they might try to scam you by charging full price on something you are covered for.", "date": "2014-08-01 12:57:51"}

I usually have a 3 strikes and you're out policy... If this were a baseball game, the Red Martini's winning streak would be in the negatives!\n\nIt was my high school English teacher's birthday and because she lives I'm the Durham Region we usually dine somewhere in Pickering or Ajax. It gets me out of Toronto once in awhile.  So I had made reservations for 7pm. When we arrived there were 2 occupied tables in the downstairs bar lounge.  We stood there for 5 minutes with no sign of any hostess or staff.  After what seemed like an eternal wait, the waitress appeared and she told us we could choose a table either upstairs or downstairs.  We opted for the upper level.\n\nThe Red Martini is a house-converted restaurant, similar to 22 Church Street Bistro across the street.  A co-worker told me that the 2 restaurant are owned by the same owner, however this is unconfirmed.  However I did spot a lot of similarities.\n\nOnce we chose our table, again we were left unattended and ignored for awhile. We quickly realized that the waitress who \"greeted\" us downstairs was the only staff in the front end for the entire restaurant. Strike 1 - understaffed.\n\nMy high school English teacher loves her white wine and she usually orders the house white.  Strike 2 - they were out of their house white.  This is a clear indication of poor restaurant management.  So we had no other choice than to order the next available white wine which was twice the cost.\n\nWe waited for our appetizer - no bread basket appeared - Strike 3 and you're out! \n\nWe ordered and shared the Stuffed Portobello Mushroom Salad to start. This could've easily been THE best tasting salad I've ever had in my life. However, the minor neglect in detail made it second best.  The salad was a deconstructed-style salad. The grilled portobello mushrooms were delicious. The \"stuffing\" was made from imitation crab meat and eggs... So essentially it tasted like an egg salad.  It was also served with COLD naan bread... It would've been the perfect salad if they grilled the naan. We had requested that the appetizer come first and then our mains... However the server showed up 2 minutes into us digging into our salads, so we had to send her back to the kitchen and requested the food be kept warm.\n\nMy Coconut Tilapia was served with a spicy plum sauce, Bok Choy, red and yellow bell peppers and jasmine rice. When I first bit into the tilapia I was excited that the fish skin was so crisp... But I quickly realized that the crisp was not due to skillful culinary execution, but rather to a burnt fish... Parts of it were so burnt I started tasting charcoal!  Also, the \"coconut\" component of the dish was M.I.A.  This dish had so much potential.. *sigh*\n\nI didn't try my teacher's Veggie Stir-Fry with Chicken but the feedback I got from her wad that the vegetables were cooked to a mush, and that the chicken was dry.  In their defense, the mush factor may have been a result of the dish being kept on a warming plate.\n\nTo finish we ordered a cappuccino, tea and marbled cheesecake.  The server came back up to inform me that they don't offer cappuccino... How do you not know that?  Its like she was a temp hired to tide over a quiet Sunday restaurant service.  So I settled for a coffee.  \n\nThe cheesecake was average, nothing spectacular.  \n\nAt the end of the day, the bill came to $105.

This location is newer, bigger, and more modern. It has bright colours, and lots of electronic signage for menus, etc. Although the food tasted okay, the rest of the experience was a bit annoying.\n\nIt was loud! There was a constant clanging of metal on metal with the cooks banging metal spatulas against the grill to chop up the meats they were cooking. There was a doorbell chime every few minutes. All of trhis contibuted to some miscommunication and missed communication.\n\nOrders are placed at the counter  and they take your name to call you when it's ready. My friends had already ordered and paid and I ordered the Osmow's Mixed Grill (Mix of chicken shawarma, a skewer of lamb kofta, chicken kebab, and Osmow's Special chicken with pineapple all grilled together with saut\u00e9ed green peppers and onions and sauced to perfection with our famous Osmow's sauces and your choice of two sides). I chose rice and Greek salad (with no cucumbers ) as my sides. The server said this would take 12-15 minutes to prepare. How many of these could they serve?\n\nMy friends were already eating their Chicken on the Stix. It's really just chicken shawarma on fries with the house sauces. Chicken on the Rocks is rice instead of fries. Confusing names. It was a large serving but the flavour was a bit bland.\n\nI never heard my name called over the ambient noise but my order was ready. It was a very generouse serving of meat over rice, with the salad in a separate container. Despite my request, there were cucumbers in the salad, and not enough dressing. Suppose I was allergic to cucumbers?\n\nThis meat had more flavour than the other dish but it was hard to tell what we were eating. Everything was chopped up and piled on top of the rice and covered with sauces, making it all look the same. The sauces, while tasty, made everything kinda taste the same. This was not as enjoyable as anticipated. I took most of it home.\n\nTheir presentation needs a lot of work. Everything is served in takeout containers, piled on top of each other and covered in sauces, unlike all the photos on display in the store. Those were nicely plated on real plates with each item distinguishable from the other.\n\nAs much as I like shawarma, these issues make this location a no-fly zone for me.", "date": "2018-08-11 16:14:11"}

There are TVs in every booth and plenty around the bar. The music was played at various levels throughout our visit and was sometimes annoying and/or too hard (it just didn't suit the atmosphere at the time). We were there on a Saturday for lunch and to my surprise, the majority of the patrons seemed to be in the 60+ range... of course, we were there with my parents so that didn't help matters either.\n\nThere lunch menu has a wide variety of food most of which is under $10.00 but you can also order from their main menu with prices ranging between $10.00 - $14.00. \n\nWe ordered:\nBangers and Mash - $10.99 (from the main menu)\nWings and Salad - $8.99 (lunch menu)\nLasagna with Garlic Bread - $7.99 (lunch menu)\nSoup and Corn Beef on a Kaiser - $7.99 (lunch menu)\n\nSince I have to try every restaurant's Bangers and Mash, that was my main. They serve it in the traditional fashion with baked beans on the side however, they also covered it in fried mushrooms and onions which actually added a nice touch. The bangers on the other hand were like little stubby sausages and really fatty... not my idea of a proper banger. Two stars for that dish.\n\nThe Lasagna looked so good that I had to have a bite. I wish I had ordered that instead!  The picture doesn't do it justice but the portion size was quite large. It was so cheesy and meaty and the pasta was cooked perfectly. A really nice dish.\n\nThe wings were really plump and meaty. The order included five wings, carrot and celery sticks and your choice of side. My husband opted for the Caesar Salad.  I must say, the 'ranch' dressing that is served with the wings is home made and is to die for! If you like garlic, you'll LOVE this.\n\nThe Soup and Corn beef on a Kaiser was served with a side of coleslaw and although I didn't get a chance to try it, it looked quite nice and my father seemed to enjoy it. Again, great portion size for the money!\n\nOh... and one more thing...\n\nNow I must say, I'm not one that is often willing to venture into a restaurant loo but these took me by surprise! Wall to wall marble and they're immaculately clean! It was almost as if you were stepping into a spa... quite strange if compared to the rest of the atmosphere, but in a nice way.\n\nOverall, even though I wasn't all that pleased with my meal, the rest of the experience was fine and the menu has a plentiful selection sure to please the masses. The service was quick and friendly and the loo's are fantastic. What more can you ask for?", "date": "2012-06-17 12:26:22"}

It comes with just sauce and cheese, veggies (peppers, mushrooms, onions extra 50cents). I added peppers. Total came to $7.90. Kinda steep but for homemade, it's worth it. \n\nSo I didn't get anything else, just this sandwich and it's okay..., I've definitely had better. For one, the breeding on the chicken had turned to mush, so wasn't crispy, or even soft, it was mushy. Second, not much cheese put on it.

Employees here are very welcoming, dedicated and loyal to the brand.  \n\nSome quick tips: Start off with the baby or mini size.  With the number of times they dip the cone into the melted chocolate (of your choice), it'll be sugar overload.  If you can eat more, then hey, you can try other flavours and toppings!\n\nThe soft serve ice cream itself is delicious.  Very creamy! I'm sure many people will focus more on the toppings but if you're someone looking for just a regular/plain soft serve ice cream, then you won't be disappointed. \n\nI haven't tasted all of the chocolate sauce but so far, the ones I've tried are very good.  Seems as though they had taken chocolate bars and just melted them as they are quite rich.  Whenever you get a cone, they dip the ice cream 2 to 3 times and in the end, the chocolate coating will be pretty thick.  This is why I recommend starting off with a baby or mini size.  \n\nWhether or not you're very much into sweets and may or may not find it too be too much, it'll still taste really good.

There was nothing fine dining about the atmosphere or he service. It was a bar room experience at fine dining prices.\nThe food was the only thing left to rescue the evening and it was a disaster. I ordered the pork tenderloin which was so overcooked that I thought they has served a pork chop with the bone in. It was also flavorless and burnt. My dining companions also expressed great disappointment with their meals, using terms like flavorless, over-cooked and cold.\nWe quickly paid the bill and left to seek a more appropriate venue for dessert and coffee. By this time even Tim Horton's seemed appealing.\nAvoid this restaurant. The only thing that is fine dining is the pricing.", "date": "2011-05-09 11:54:41"}

Their delivery was within the stated time window.\n\nBe prepared to pay a few hundred dollars over the estimate, and remember that an estimate is... just an estimate!

My advice to you is to ensure you get into direct contact with the truck driver, that way you don't have to play telephone via the Rockbrune/UVL dispatchers.

Still not as good as what you can get in Niagara, but by far the best I have been able to find so far.  I tweaked the sandwich a little bit... asked for no hot sauce (normally they add mild, medium or hot), asked for hot peppers instead of green peppers.  The rest of the sandwich had fried onions, mushrooms, cheese, toasted bun.  It was great!  Next time I go I'll also add diced tomatoes and shredded lettuce.

Everything was BOMB! Best Greek food I've had in the GTA. The souvlaki was well seasoned and their fries were sooo good with the perfect amount of feta and lemon. The rice was well seasoned and my mother in law wanted to ask the owner for the recipe after eliminating rice from her diet for a while. There were 5 of us and there was not a trace of food left. The food was all made fresh to order and I couldn't help but notice how good the pita (Greek Freak Pita) looked!! Their pitas were huge and are loaded with souvlaki or gyro, fries and tzatziki. They also have gyro and whole chickens on their menu. Definitely coming back soon to try their pork gyro and to get some more of everything! The staff are super friendly so this place is a 5 star!!", "date": "2018-11-14 01:06:50"}

They have screens everywhere and even by the tables if you're eating at a booth. We came on a Saturday night when the Leafs we're playing and it packed! It's loud. Not good for dates or if you're trying to have a nice conversation with someone! It's probably a great atmosphere during playoff tho!\n\nSo we ate the munch platter. Best parts of it was the wings and onion rings. We also got a side of Greek salad and it was actually really good! If they make a side salad that tasty then I'm pretty hopeful the other menu items taste good too! Servings for any dish are large so it's ideal for sharing. We'll probably come back here and try the other menu items.", "date": "2017-10-01 02:20:45"}

Although I am a bulldog nutrition athlete, I find myself time to time at Popeyes because they carry a few brands that bulldog doesn't. Which is kudos for them. Everything is very organized and they've got tons of supps for every diet, every athlete. \n\nThey also have good deals every now and then! Up to 50% off of items. \n\nI don't think a lot of the associates here are genuinely nice, especially the females. It's a very fake kind of retail store nice, and the overall attitude was not great. After I rejected making an account there, she turned very unfriendly and cold. Also did not give me my Popeye's dollars which I qualified for because I spent enough $, and when I asked, she said you can't get them unless you're a Popeye's member. Which is not true because I've collected many Popeye's dollars from different stores. Definitely lied because she didn't want to deal with me anymore, so ew I definitely left very unpleasantly. \n\nEvery fucking Durham chick working in a supps store thinks she's almighty because she's a fucking bikini competitor and tbh I'm not going back to this location anymore because I'm salty af because they're sour af. \n\nPs. Send me my damn Popeye's dollars to my address.", "date": "2018-04-07 21:45:28"}

We arrived at 730 on a Friday night, the place was full! It looked like a couple of tables were ready to leave so we waited. No one greeted us at the door the whole 25 minutes we were there. When the waitress cleaned off a table we actually had to go and ask if we can take it instead of them inviting us to sit. It's a very small place with maybe about 15 tables (all were full) so maybe they were too busy to be friendly. \n\nI ordered the chimichanga and my boyfriend ordered the chorizo tacos. The chimichanga was pretty disappointing, just meat and blobs of cheese stuffed into a tortilla and deep-fried. The meat wasn't very flavourful. The chorizo tacos were absolutely delicious on the other hand and I would recommend trying that. The diablo habanero sauce is amazing but not for the faint hearted. \n\nI would come here again when it wasn't so busy as the service was quite lacking and we had to wait a long time to get our order taken and our food.", "date": "2016-03-06 00:16:55"}

How can you go wrong with book for under $10?! \n\nOver the years Chapters has really expanded and offers way more than reading material for your bathroom!  Home decor (picture frames, knick knacks, candles); glassware; perfumes/soaps; jewelry and accessories- the lust goes on!\n\nThis is one location where I've also seen them carry the Honor brand - the Jessica Alba brand of products.\n\nThe staff are always friendly- asking me if they can help me and just by being on the floor.

Our server made two mistakes and the second time we felt bad so we didn't want to say anything, however she remembered and kept apologizing (with cones/cups). The shop itself is really clean and a cute spot to catch up with family or friends and crave your sweet tooth.\n\nThey have a variety of items, however they specialize in ice-cream. You get to choose your base ice-cream, the dip and toppings. I personally got the classic milk kooky cup (decided not to get it in a cone) and it was so good! I loved it! I also got to try some of the dulce de leche kooky cup which was also amazing, but a bit too sweet for my taste.\n\nHighly recommend this place!", "date": "2018-03-31 18:05:12"}
