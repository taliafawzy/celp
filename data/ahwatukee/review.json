Hook it up to your Southwest Rapid Rewards Number (or your airline loyalty program of choice) to earn points there. \n\nIt also helps expedite getting into your rental as everything is prepped in advance of your arrival. \n\nAll that being said, fairly easy Hertz location to rent from whether it's business, pleasure or an insurance claim rental.

Each class is identical in format and there's not a lot of difference in the progression levels. It's easy for a child to get bored with the activities, even if you only go once a week. \n\nI had my son enrolled in swim lessons with Aqua-Tots for 5 months. In that whole time there was only one class (that we weren't doing a make-up class on a different day) that the regular instructor Megan wasn't training a new instructor. So Megan couldn't focus on helping the students progress. She gave no instructions on how to change things to help kids advance and was solely focused on getting the new instructor through the class script. She also wasn't prepared for the class in having the right amount of equipment for all the kids -- if all the kids are at the stage of using the noodle boat, there should be one for all of them and not get huffy when her student instructors point out that all the kids need one. If we could have regularly just had class that wasn't a training for a new employee, it might have been better.\n\nWe had a good experience with Shelia and the other instructors we had on make-up days were great about helping my son progress. And at each of the make-up classes we did, the other instructors were always surprised that my son was actually more advanced than his progress card would indicate. We had been doing swim lessons since infancy in our previous city so my son already had many of the skills being taught.", "date": "2017-09-22 22:02:53"}

Imagine a piece of dough, SMOTHERED in sauce, with about 5 blobs of cheese on it. I dont know where this is considered pizza, but im glad i do not live there.

Even after re-cutting the entire pizza, when me or my kids tried to pull a pice out, all the sauce and cheese( If that piece actually had cheese on it, because yes, some slices didnt have any cheese at all)  just slid into the box, leaving us with a flimsy, cold piece of dough.\nEPIC FAIL\n\nThe Patagonian.\nThis pizza was just a shard better, as far as flavors go.\nBut, it also was cold, undercooked, and stuck to the paper in the box.\n\nAnd lets not forget the prices.

One is the size of the large pizza. It is a little disappointing. It looks very small for a large. Second, and this is just personal preference, I prefer my crust to be a little on the crispy side. Their crust becomes a little soggy. It just doesn't stand up to the sauce very well. But other than that, the pizza tastes amazing! And their prices are pretty reasonable, too. Unfortunately, I won't be going back because they aren't close to where I live (I was visiting a friend across town).

The salad arrived pretty fast, since our server placed the order in BEFORE asking us which pizza we wanted.  (Our pizza also arrived later, bec. the kitchen took extra time to wipe down the oven's surface of as much cornmeal as possible to mitigate possible allergic reactions I might come down w/...)  Believe you me, this pizza was worth waiting for!\n\nThe mista consisted of mixed greens, tomato wedges, crunchy walnuts, feta, and Florencia's fantastic balsamic vinaigrette.  (You can purchase the vinaigrette to take home!)  This salad was so delicious and so much fun to eat (crunchy walnuts, creamy feta, and tangy vinaigrette were the secrets to this simple, yet delightful salad!), I could see myself coming back and ordering a small order for my main meal and be completely satisfied.  In fact, I WAS satisfied w/ my half of the salad and could've gone to the movie we were planning to see, but didn't, bec. we had to wait an extra 30 minutes or so for the pizza to arrive.  No worries, though, as the Clevenger was even MORE spectacular than the Bravo I tried the first time around!  (And if you read my first review, you can see how much I loved that combination-- I ate half of the medium pizza at one sitting!)\n\nI apologize for the terrible photos of the pizza I've included here...

I ordered a large thin crust pizza and small salad for takeout and was told to arrive in 15-20 minutes. The location is very easy to get to, and the parking is so-so. I was expecting a packed restaurant as all the spaces near the entrance were taken but when I walked inside, the place was maybe at 65% capacity. I know it's nit picky but it was a head scratcher for me, and when you are taking your pizza home you want somewhere near the exit to get in the car and take hot food home. Inside, the restaurant was clean and quickly seemed very family friendly- with lots of kids. So keep that in mind if you are a younger couple seeking a quiet \"romantic\" dinner- this spot is definitely kid friendly (good for me!). I walked up to the bar and was immediately attended to- there were 3 or 4 staff members behind the counter and they were expediently helping other patrons. I remember the place playing good music in the background (sort of indie themed) - with some Postal Service and MGMT. I paid $23 for the food (that includes a tip) - so I was happy with the prices. The pizza arrived a few minutes later, nice and hot. After getting home the family ripped into the food- and it was very good. The crust is the standout here- crispy, almost burnt. Very, very good flavor. The sauce seemed to be on the sweeter side- and the cheese was good. It was a little greasy, but that's because they put a lot of cheese on. The salad was good- and the house balsamic dressing was awesome. We will certainly be back to Florencia's for another trip- maybe bring the kiddo and eat inside next time!!", "date": "2013-02-02 16:28:55"}

Well, have a look at the photos and see just how much I had!  Florencia's thin-crust pizzas normally contain cornmeal, but I was able to specially-request one without.  Fabulous!  The bruschetta was oh, so very good-- the tangy-sweet balsamic vinegar is key in making it so tasty.  :)  Liked the fact that it had a lot of garlic, too!  The only downside, so far, was that the desserts I inquired about were all pre-made [cannoli shells came dusted w/ powdered sugar from the supplier (Kim wasn't sure that the pastry cream had powdered sugar in it, but w/ the shells being pre-dusted, the point was already moot!), the caramelized walnuts, for the Apples and walnuts w/ ice cream dessert,   didn't come w/ nutritional info (were they made w/ granulated or powdered sugar?), and ice cream wasn't homemade...  I wonder if Florencia makes its own cookie batter for its chocolate chip cookies (freshly-baked and then topped w/ ice cream)?  Again, w/ the ice cream not being homemade, this scratched out another dessert option for me.  With desserts being a non-issue, I'm able to eat more crusty pizza to my heart's content!  A very glittery silver-lining, which you'll soon agree with!  :D\n\nVery patient and fast service- ask for Kim.  Nice, non-intrusive music playing in the background, but the restaurant got a lot noisier as the room slowly filled w/ dinner traffic, so come in early to avoid it.  Restroom was clean and very spacious-- there were two stalls when three would've easily fit!

Now to the pie, I am not sure where other people order pies from but here is my feedback: the crust, this was soft and part doughy didn't do well with the toppings on the pie.

Ahwatukee has a lot of these little hidden gems because most of them are located in strip malls. This one has been around for quite some time and resides next door to the popular Melting Pot. They offer three types of pizza - Traditional, Olive Oil (Garlic, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Mozzarella Cheese with no tomato sauce) and Pesto (Basil Pesto Sauce with no tomato sauce). You can create your own with toppings (over 40 topping choices) or choose from one of their popular specialty pizza creations. Some of the names include the Snow White, Pomodora, Valentinos, Winchester, Clevenger, Malanzane, Bo-Be and the Green-Eyed Chicken. There are many more creations to choose from and they have vegetarian options as well. The dough is house made and their pizzas are thin-crust. I'm more of a thick crust person myself but actually found their thin crust quite enjoyable. They also have panini, calzones, salads and sandwiches if pizza is not on your radar. Their appetizer menu is not incredibly large but they have a nice variety to choose from.\u00a0I got the mozzarella sticks and felt they were just average. We ordered the Clark's Classic pizza which consisted of pepperoni and chicken marinated in buffalo sauce. I was a little worried the sauce would soak through the thin crust and make it soggy but it actually held up (even eating it as a leftover the next day). There is a small bar area to the side where you can order a glass of wine or beer. The owner is a Wildcat fan (boo...) and they've had fun fundraisers in the past during the annual ASU/UA football game to benefit the local high schools in the area. It wasn't very busy when I visited but service was pretty good.", "date": "2018-01-14 16:05:07"}

We had a hard time finding a good \"pizza place\" coming from the East Coast and had our fair share of disappointing pies over the past 3 1/2 years.

My husband is an easy extra cheese and pepperoni guy and it never disappoints! We get small individual pies and I'm always satisfied after half so I get to save the rest and relive the \"yummy\" for lunch the next day. For the two small pies it's about $24 which is really no different than we've paid for large pies (to share) from mediocre places. The inside is really quite cute and though we've only done takeout, we'll definitely be dining in sooner than later. The hostesses and ladies behind the bar are always super friendly when we go pick up our food and I appreciate the \"family\" feel of the restaurant.

I can say that because I've done both. Very romantic and dimly lit inside, perfect for date night. But also has a small bar area that has a sports game or two on, but it never gets too loud. Or, if you're home and want something better than delivery and definitely a lot better than Little Ceasar's, then this is the place to go for pick up.\nWe have found that after our many visits, our favorite appetizer is the Barry's Pesto Bread. Be mindful though, this does come with walnuts. That being said, you'd think, \"Walnuts do not go on bread!\" Oh but my dear reader, they most certainly do, especially with the pesto, pepper, jalapeno and mozzarella combination. It's one of those odd but happy couples.\nOur favorite, which is a tough one to choose from is definitely going the be the Gladiator. Close was the Margharita pizza. The Gladiator just suits my carnivoric appetite a lot better and is much more hearty. We always order a medium because we never learn that we really need a large.\nGreat place. Great food.

They do not deliver, but it is close enough that I can place a phone order and the order is usually ready by the time I get there.\n\nSERVICE: Service is hit and miss.  I'd love to say they were spot on all the time because everyone is so darned nice there.  There are problems in a couple areas:\n\n1.) It can be difficult to get refills, napkins, or anything really after your food has been dropped off.  We have experienced this on a couple occasions, even when we were frantically removing everything off the table when a friend's child spilled my child's glass of milk.  Even having made eye contact with the hostesses who were looking on, it took several minutes to get anyone to come to our aid.  \n\n2.) They seem helpless when it comes to splitting a bill, even though we mentioned when we were seated we would need two bills and essentially sat by family at two different tables which were just pushed together.  When there was a problem with one bill, it took 20 minutes to correct the problem.  We wanted to get our kids home, but the waitress had our cards so we had to wait.  And, even with someone's help, our bill still came out wrong.  We paid it so we could just get out of there.\n\nFOOD: Some things are GREAT.  Some things are just MEH.  The panini pizzetta is a huge hit with DD.  It's better than their garlic bread.  Their homemade balsamic is addictive and AMAZING.  The fresh mozzarella they put on the Caprese and Spinach salads is so delicious!  One time I had The Green Eyed Chicken (a pesto pizza) and it was FANTASTIC.  Another time I had it and it tasted extremely bland... like they forgot to put something on it.  The Snow White pizza is very bland.  Ditto for The Ranchero, which is surprising.  We really thought it would pack more flavor; however, it just tasted like seasoned chicken on bread with some cheese on it.\n\nAMBIENCE: I actually like this place.  It is very cute, but not overly so.  It is a little dark in the dining room at night.  It is usually great for conversation, as it is not too loud most nights.\n\nOverall, this place is nice for a get-together with friends.  They have beer specials and they're conveniently located for Foothills residents.  \nLet's call it a 3.5* to be generous.", "date": "2012-04-24 02:53:01"}

The all female about high school age waitstaff walked by my table at least 5 times, did not make eye contact, did not even ask if I want a glass of water. I was getting ready to just leave when a waitress came closer, I asked if there was anyone covering this section, when she approached the table with quite an attitude. She looked down her glasses at me and said \"oh your waitress is busy and she will be right here.\" I said \"I've been sitting here for over 10 minutes and NO ONE has even noticed.\" She huffed and walked away.

I drive by Florencia everyday and we keep saying we need to check out some of the establishments in this shopping center. Yelp says it's good, so obviously, I trust the palettes of my fellow Yelpers. We headed up there, it was pretty dead and the owner met us at the door and said we could only get takeout because they were closing up at little early. It was only about a half hour early and the guy was real cool about it, so we were fine with it. We went up to the bar and ordered a 12 inch pepperoni and italian sausage. All the girls at the bar seemed really sweet. They told us about 15 mins, so we sat down to wait, one of the girls came around to offer us something to drink while we waited, which I thought was nice. I can see some of the comments about the decor. At first I thought it was odd that the floor is just concrete, but it actually all kind of grew on me after sitting there for a bit. It has kind of a rustic tavern-ish feel. We started talking to Val, the owner, who was a real nice guy. Telling us about the place, they've been there for 11 years I think he said, so it's a nice neighborhood joint. He was real down to earth, just sitting at the bar drinking a beer and catching the end of the game. We noted that they had a pretty interesting beer selection both on draft and in bottles, which he said he rotates fairly frequently. He seems to have a pretty strong passion for beer and real interested in getting in some local brews and interesting selections in there. We got our pizza home and it was cheesy and delicious. The crust wasn't super flavorful, but the texture was perfectly crusty on the outside, soft on the inside. The sauce had good flavor and the ingredients tasted like high quality. The pepperoni had a real nice rich flavor and the sausage had a nice flavor with the fennel and other herbs and spices. True it was a little on the expensive side but I'd rather give my money to a nice guy like Val than to Domino's any day. I'm looking forward to heading up there again to sit at the bar, watch a game and enjoy some more pizza or perhaps one of his calzones with a local brew!", "date": "2010-11-02 04:49:24"}

We got to the restaurant and it was not too busy, just a few tables. The restaurant was a nice looking restaurant, it was painted a nice color and had interesting metal wall hangings. We're having pizza for dinner tonight so we decided to get a couple sandwiches and the bruschetta. Our server seemed pretty miserable to be there and had a really flat voice. She was not so pleasant. We got the bruschetta and it was not exactly what you would expect. It was like a cheesy garlic bread with tomatoes, garlic, basil, and their balsamic dressing on it. I thought it was pretty good, although the tomatoes were not so fresh and the bread they chose was odd for a bruschetta. The BF, however, really didn't like it. He thought it tasted 'weird.' So then we waited a bit and our sandwiches came out. Here is the real reason for the bad review. The sandwiches just weren't good. I got the chicken panini and the BF got the meatball parm. The meatball parm was really bad. The sauce had no flavor, the meatballs tasted like they were once frozen, and there was a ridiculous amount of cheese on top, like 3/4 of an inch thick. My sandwich was ridiculous. It was giant and looked like a giant salad on bread. The chicken was a breaded cutlet... not super tasty, and supposedly it had their balsamic dressing on it, but I couldn't taste it. It had a lot of raw red onion on it which took over the flavor, and when I took it off all I could taste was the 'pizzette' bread which was overwhelmingly garlicky. I love garlic, but this was too much. It was almost bitter in my mouth. So maybe their pizza is good... I don't know, but what we got was not good.

We sat until 6:08 before someone finally greeted us. It was super awkward too because every server kept looking at us and making eye contact but no one ever cared to come by and get a drink order. Finally greeted,  I asked the waitress if we could order a few items from the HH menu because we sat down prior to it ending - she acted as if I was asking for too much \"Ummmm I can't access those buttons after 6pm I'll see if that's even possible\" as if I was in the wrong for asking! Our brushetta came out promptly however, it was much less in taste then I expected. They only had 4 selections and you picked 3 to complete your board - not much variety. The tomatoes were slimy to the point I had to undress each piece just to stomach it. Wasn't pleased.

We were greeted by the staff immediately, and were offered a seat on the patio as there was live music.  The musician was fantastic and added the perfect ambiance for a nice dinner.\n\nOur waitress was Sharon, and she had good knowledge of the menu suggesting a great red wine for myself and a beer for my boyfriend.  We decided to order a cheese plate, and I have to admit this was the one thing we were disappointed by.  The cheese was good, however it was a small portion.  The prosciutto was a bit too sweet and neither of us chose to finish the portion we were served.\n\nOnto the entrees...we decided to go with the flat breads and share so we could sample two.  The boy chose the classic, no mushroom.  It was very flavorful and generous on the toppings.  The second was absolutely delicious!  I went with the Bacon and Squash and was impressed by the richness of the toppings without being overpowering.  Definitely a must try!\n\nNext time we will probably go with the bruschetta to start, as we saw a few being served and they looked tasty.  Our waitress suggested dessert, however the meal was filling and we did not save room.\n\nOverall the experience was wonderful for a date night!  The live music was not overpowering, and there was even a large birthday party going on that did not take over our experience.   The restaurant itself was nice, very open and accommodating for happy hour, however the patio really hit home for us and I am glad we sat outside.  4.5 stars for food and drink, bumped up a notch for the live music.  \n\nDefinitely a must try if you like personal attention from the wait staff, good wine, and a beautiful patio to enjoy your meal on.", "date": "2013-10-08 00:40:18"}

Both times were great, the staff makes the place a charm to attend and go to.\n\n~Fud/Drink~\nWell, the food takes an obvious second place to the wines in house, which there are plenty of. The staff understands how to interpret your pallet well, and easily helped guide my fiance and self through the options we had. We ordered some Sweet Red they had on the shelf which was perfect with the pizza we ordered. The pizza was a fine thin crust with yummy add-ins like pepperoni and olives, etc. The wines here all are fantastic, we had a hard time choosing from the selection they keep stock of. They also have some beers if you prefer that, although I believe the selection has changed. \n\n~Atmosphere~ \nIt has a quiet, local and relaxing quality to it. I felt right at home and our waitress on each occasion was welcoming and attentive. It has a lot of homey qualities to the site, the bar area has a TV but its not in your face, allowing me the chance to pay attention to whom I am with, rather than other disturbances. They have an outdoor patio we briefly skimmed over. Next time I go I'll update on it so you have a feel for what it provides, etc. There is a general sense that loud noise is well out of the norm here, so boisterous parties are probably best left for reserving space for an event. \n\n~Extras/Rating~\nThey do host events, and they do a great job at hosting them from what I have heard. It is an awesome idea for a date, there isn't a better idea for a first date then some wine and pizza to chill to while you talk. They get 4 stars for having a good blend of food and wine/beer selection as well. Plus on top of that, the ambiance is perfectly romantic and will leave you with a great lasting memory!

I walked in here with absolutely no expectations of food but that quickly changed when I scanned through a rather comprehensive list of food items that they had to offer. We both picked a glass of wine each, which were $2 off because of happy hour. We decided to start with an order of French onion dumplings and truffle fries. The dumplings were perfectly done.. with crispy edges on the exterior and a beautifully cheesy filling. They serve it with au jus which we chose not to pour on over the dumplings. Instead, we opened them just enough to pour the jus directly inside them individually. Best. Decision. Ever. The flavors with spot on and the crunch from the dumpling wrapper was a really nice touch. \n\nThe fries however fell really short. They were cut really thick and didn't get enough time in the fryer. They turned out soggy and limp.. quite easily one of the worst I've had. My disappointment kinda fell on the wayside because I was still savoring the wine and dumplings.

It was date night, so I figured why not.  We arrived and the place was fairly busy, but not packed.  We were immediately greeted by all three members of the front-of-house staff. We were able to get a table against the wall in a booth-combo setup.\n\nKatie, the bar manager, arrived promptly and said that we made it for happy hour and explained all the HH specials. The deals are good, especially if you want to explore some new wine tastes at a reasonable by the glass price.  Anyway, she asked us what brought us in and I explained the Yelp search.  She then told us that the DJ wasn't playing but a new young guitar player was going to be doing acoustic blues.  We were totally down with that.\n\nWe ordered two beers and a bruschetta combo.  The bruschetta was very unique, on good artisan bread, and topped with well created toppings.  We ordered the Caprese with tomato, basil, and fresh mozzarella; the Spanish, with mozzarella and thinly sliced chorizo with red peppers, and the brie and caramelized red onion.  It was a nice selection, and at only $11 was more than enough food to start our evening.  We took advantage of the happy hour food specials by ordering the tempura green beans with spicy aioli on the side.  The tempura was crisp, but left a little too much grease.  The flavor was really good and the aioli was a good accompaniment.   We were content.\n\nAs the end of happy hour approached, we decided to order two glasses of wine and were given direction by Katie, who is also My Wine Cellar's sommelier.  She did a great job of listening to our likes and matched two wines to our flavor profiles perfectly.  My wife had the Redwood Pinot Noir and I had the Crucillon Garnacha, a Spanish Zinfandel.\n\nThe music started and it was pleasant, although we were very close to the artist, so we decided to move to the bar.  It was also a little warm back in the corner and the bar was much cooler.  At the bar, we ordered two flatbreads, my wife opting to revisit the brie and caramelized red onion (she loved it), and me choosing the house specialty, The Territorial, a bbq-styled treat with short rib meat and provolone.  It was excellent.\n\nOur evening at My Wine Cellar was thoroughly enjoyable, with each member of the staff conscientiously attending to every detail, engaging in pleasant conversation, and understanding how to take care of their customers.\n\nWe will surely return and look forward to sampling some other wonderful tapas and small plates, although I may not be able to get my wife to stray from her beloved brie and caramelized red onion now.", "date": "2012-07-22 19:25:09"}

I love the idea of a cozy wine bar just a few blocks from my house and that is what this place seems to be. I walk in and the atmosphere is quite cozy and even though there is not a huge crowd of people. The bar is usually full enough and everyone is chatting and appears to be having a good time. Even though the staff is welcoming, I still get this feeling like I'm an \"outsider\" and not quite a \"regular\" yet. Can't really place my finger on why.\n\nThe happy hour prices and selection for beer and wine are fantastic! Full price would be a little more than I would like to spend, but then again I love a good deal so anything \"full price\" just seems like I'm missing out. We used Living Social coupon a few days before the expiration and were a little bummed that the coupon wasn't good for the happy hour prices. I know this is somewhat typical, however that just makes the restaurants that DO allow the coupons during happy stand out that much more!\n\nIn the time that I have had food (after the ownership change and before), I think it is obvious this place is all about the wine and the food is an afterthought. Nothing wrong with that. I think it is necessary to offer food if you want people to stay and drink a while; we've got to have something to snack on! Bruschettas, thin and crispy pizzas, and salads all with great descriptions on the menu, but the execution leave a little to be desired. Some of the appetizers taste like I could have just gone to Trader Joe's or Costco and purchased the same thing myself.\n\nI promise I am not trying to make this sound bad, I will go back to the wine cellar when I want to relax (but not at home, but not too far away either) with a good glass of wine and a calm, cozy atmosphere. I do like to go there, but I think I like the idea more than the reality. It seems as if there is some unrealized potential at the wine cellar, or maybe that is just the optimist in me. The lesson here is that I will be sure to go during the \"happy\" hours and I won't go when I'm hungry.", "date": "2011-06-09 03:03:07"}

Behind the restaurant is a outdoor patio area with occasional live music. Its relaxing atmosphere makes it a great place for a date night or a quiet night out with friends. I've always enjoyed their selection of wines. They have some wine flights to choose from or you can order by the glass or bottle. I haven't had many opportunities to try their food. I went on a Wednesday and got their bottle of wine and flatbread for $25 (they have different specials on weekdays). I got the brie and prosciutto flatbread and thought it was pretty good.

We've given it 3 shots but our experience has been consistent. The first time we stopped in for dinner on a busy evening and sat on the patio. We really enjoyed our wine and tapas meal but our server was incredibly inattentive and we had to chase her down every time we wanted anything. I brushed that off to a really busy night so we returned for a second visit. This time it wasn't that busy so we enjoyed a nice bottle of wine and food. Again, a really inattentive server. When we wanted to check out we literally had to go find her. 3rd try - stopped in for a glass of wine in the early evening. Unfortunately the 3rd visit was the worst. I asked the server if they had happy hour specials and she informed me that yes and we had just made it with 10 minutes left. When we were ready to order we couldn't find her anywhere so went to the bar hoping to make the happy hour deadline. She then came to the table and took our order. 30 seconds later she comes back telling us \"Sorry, you missed the cut-off for happy hour\".....yeah, we missed it because you never came back! Grrrr......We received our wine and waited for our food (we only ordered two really simple appetizers)...and waited....and waited. No one came by so we went up to the bar again to ask about our food. When our server came back she said sorry but our deep fryer broke today and we had to run out to Kohl's and buy a little fryer and that big table was ahead of you. Seriously???? It's bad enough that they are cooking with a Fry Daddy but never never tell your customers something like that.  After 40 full minutes we received our appetizers, our wine glasses empty. No, she didn't ask if we wanted another glass. She then came back to tell us that her shift was over but no worries, that other girl will take care of you. \"That other girl\" never came by....ever. We had to go up to the bar once again and ask for our check. I fully expected a discount because of the fiasco but no. Not even an apology. So I told them our experience and the manager came over. She said she was happy to take off one appetizer. Great. Except she talked a little too long about all the problems they were having in the kitchen today. So we waited for our revised bill....and waited....and waited. Are you kidding me? We had to go up to the bar to get the check.

We order some wine - mind you there was no recommendation or comment on our choice. Whatever. Then we order some bruschetta based appetizers and gnocchi and soup. Bruschetta arrives and i am real disappointed that its just a bruschetta bread sliced real thick and not even toasted. How not cool. \nThen gnocchi arrives. It tasted ok but was cold in some parts and kinda skimpy on sauce. Is it possible it was nuked? By that time 2 man band started to play. They were pretty good and played some soft rock and country without overpowering whole place, like it often happens. But wait, why talk of the band if food review if not over, was not there soup involved? Hehe we wondered what happened to that as well. \"Oppps, you right\". Few minutes after our reminder it came. And not it was not worse the wait :( Too bland, too sweet. Not that great after all. \nWe also got coffee and desert. Both were alright but nothing to write home about. Just ok.\n\nPerhaps, if you come there with a few friends, do not care much about food and just drink the wine and listen to music it would be much better. We came there for a dinner and wine. Wine was good, dinner was not.\n\nThis place barely gets 3 stars from me. I am pretty sure i aint coming back either. Bleah.\n\n\"I no like\"\n\nEugene", "date": "2008-01-18 04:35:38"}

Appetizers were amazing, service was great, always came back to check if we wanted more drinks or food.

To join the club you commit to a six month membership at $35/mo for 2 bottles of wine of their choosing or $55 for 3 bottles per month.  If you attend the wine tasting you have to pay an additional $15 for that. \n\nIf you're not a member the wine tasting costs $20 per person to taste 3 wines and eat some appetizers that are paired with the food.  We thought we'd sit in on this session and decide to join after the experience.\n\nWe were not impressed and we did not join.  This is why:  At each wine club event, three wines are showcased, two reds and a white.  Their wine expert stands on a little stool and yells out a story about each wine, it's origin, etc.  I had difficulty hearing what she said.  Then the servers come out and give you a piece of food to go with the first tasting. We got 2 oz of white wine and one shrimp wrapped in prosciutto.  The second tasting of red was paired with one piece of flatbread with chorizo (2x2 square) and the final tasting of red was served with a ice cream the size of a melon ball.  All that for $20. \n\nWe decided to order an appetizer and a bottle of wine (not sure why we did this).  We got a nice red and quesadillas.  The latter came out warm with a blob of melted orange plastic in between two limp tortillas.   There was about 2 oz of steak. Bland, no flavor at all.  The only thing good about it was the lime infused sour cream.  \n\nOur final bill for the \"wine tasting\", appetizer and bottle of wine plus tip?  $90!!! \n\nWe could have had a nice meal almost anywhere for that.\n\nThe owner was very brash--joking let's get them drunk so they will sign up for the club.  She asked us a few times if we were going to join.  \n\nI don't recommend joining this club and I don't recommend that you go there.  The food is okay.  There are other wine bars that do this better such as The Living Room.", "date": "2013-09-22 20:23:51"}

I did not care for the chardonnay at all.  I felt like I was drinking fruit juice.  Then I was going to try the one from Spain.

The french fries with no bacon.  They were delicious fries but I did not like the aoli.  I am just not a fan of mayonnaise based sauces.  The chick peas were my favorite appetizer that we tried.

We were able to take advantage of the happy hour (ends at 6:00p), which offeres $5 wine selections (white & red) + $5 22 oz. draft beers. You can also order discounted appetizers. We tried the chicken quesadilla and it was outstanding. The patio was quiet, clean and offered a nice view of Ahwatukee gold course. There are bistro lights that turn on when the sun sets, and we also experienced live music the night we visited (Saturday- seems the music begins around 7p). \n\nThe food was really good- after the app we tried three types of the bruschetta and all were tasty (Italian was super yum). There is a wide selection of menu items, ranging from flatbread pizzas to pasta dishes. The drink list is impressive, but know this is a wine and beer bar only. You'll have numerous options to select from- and the staff is very knowledgeable and helpful in finding the right glass of wine for you and your table. They can even help you pair your wine with food items. \n\nI'm really glad we gave My Wine Cellar a second chance.

Called to see if getting a table at 8 pm on Sat night would be a problem, she said no, come on down. We wanted to love it, as it's not far from home. It hurts me to give a place with a new owner a mediocre review. But I have to be honest.\n\nHappy that we caught Notes from Neptune playing music which is only once a month; they were REALLY good. Relaxing yet upbeat, nice sax & voices, & not too loud to hold a conversation; well-done choice of entertainment.\n\nThe blonde server helped me choose a wine, let me try one I was considering, which I appreciated. \n\nMy husband got beef sliders. They were tasty & toasted buns were a nice touch. They came with a few (a FEW) fries that seemed to be made from delicious, creamy potatoes, but were sadly soggy even though they looked pretty well-done. \n\nI ordered two apps instead of a meal - the sweet potato chips (server said they are delicious, made fresh to order) and the brussel sprouts. \n\nWe did have a staggered order, as I took a while to decide on my food. Slider order went in first. But once I did order, I waited a LONG time for the chips, much longer than the turnaround for my husband's sliders. The menu says \"hand cut,\" so maybe they actually grab a raw potato and start carefully slicing when the order makes it into the kitchen?  However, I would then expect them to be uh-oh hot. When they arrived, they had NO heat at all. Given my history as a server & restaurant manager, I'm guessing then they were left in the window a while before making it to our table.\n\nThe sweet potato chips were a shockingly small portion for the $5 price - I had to hide my surprise when they were delivered. You gotta know, we are NOT \"big portion\" people, we often split an entree when we go out, as we are not fans of the \"more is better\" concept.  But for $5, this was ridiculous, a HANDFUL. My husband sincerely said to me, \"I planned to have a few, but I'd feel guilty, as you won't have enough.\" I should have counted, could have very easily and quickly, but didn't think about it before I dove in since I was hungry. They are thin-cut, come in a cutesy little mini-deep fryer basket lined very loosely with waxy paper that therefore holds them up higher than the bottom of the basket (like the gift basket trick of putting in a false bottom to lift up the gift items). Therefore, initially they look mounding out of the little basket, with a honey dip ramekin nestled in there with them (taking up yet more space NOT full of chips). Once I removed the ramekin and looked inside, I could no longer deny that yes in fact this was a - forgive me, owner - rip off. I know what a sweet potato costs, even an organic one bought at retail price at \"Whole Paycheck\" grocery store. I'm all for places making a nice profit, but honestly... I felt kinda \"taken\" by that app. If it had been delicious, maybe if it had \"wowed\" me (I LOVE sweet potato anything), but they were un-warm, not much flavor, and the honey aioli didn't improve them for me at all (I set that to the side after two tries). \n\nThe brussel sprouts for some reason took another 15 - 20 minutes PAST the chips to arrive (no exaggeration, the band took their entire break & went back to playing while we waited for the brussels). But when they finally arrived, YUM! we agreed we should have skipped the chips AND the sliders, and just had multiple order of the brussels. (But that would be weird, \"Hi, just 2 orders of brussel sprouts, please,\" - not a reason to return). They were delivered hot, and their weight pushed that little piece of wax paper all the way down into the cutesy basket, no space-robbing ramekin, so I'm happy to say said basket was joyously full. We didn't mind paying $6 for those!  (Surely the brussel sprouts cost more than a small sweet potato?? Don't understand pricing logic here).\n\nMusic really saved the whole experience from being really mediocre. Server was very nice, but either she screwed up my order and 1. left my first item in the window and 2. forgot to put in my second item for a long time, OR this is normal kitchen flow (she didn't say anything like, \"sorry for the wait,\" so maybe this is normal?). Either way, unimpressed. \n\nSUMMARY: We agreed nothing to bring us back. However, we could see it's potential. If you hit it for happy hour prices and the music is good, and maybe when the patio is open, and the kitchen and servers are humming along, it could be a fine place to go, as others describe.  Moving on...........\n\nP.S. - Funny, I just saw that \"Phyllis\" mentioned an odor the same night we were there. We were not sitting near either bathroom. I asked my husband at one point, \"Did you fart?\" He looked shocked, swore no (and he's pretty trustworthy on that Q.) A little while later I smelled a waft again... and I realized it was the same sewage smell that happens in public bathroom drains from time to time.", "date": "2013-01-14 06:11:07"}

My friend and I just finished having days from HELL  at work and we needed some vino to soothe our frayed nerves. I suggested going here to give it a try and also for a change of scenery. Upon walking in, we were greeted warmly. We sat ourselves on two really squishy couches (not comfy). Well, we got our wine order and were left to chat. First thing I noticed, the music. I began to contemplate whether or not  \"It takes two\" by Robb Base was a good music selection while trying to unwind and chill with a glass of sauvignon blanc..hmm I'm still thinking no. Second thing I noticed was that the really young servers and bartenders were talking about deep issues of the world, but it was the explicative shouted out by the bartender who was making a very serious point, that caught our attention. I believe my friend said \"Classsssy!\" in response. So I guess that if you want to chill and have a mellow chat, My Wine Cellar is maybe not the place for it. Maybe it was an off day I don't know. On to the wine prices. I've never seen a wine bar that had all one price for all the wines on their list. It's silly. Really. And the happy hour prices aren't that wonderful. The glasses are 10 dollars, but at happy hour they're 8. Not that big of a price break considering 8 bucks is usually a regular priced glass of wine elsewhere. Just an observation. Food... not spectacular. We sent back the hummus platter we ordered because the bread was COLD, I mean out of the fridge, slap it on the plate cold. The hummus was just not tasty at all. And I LOVE hummus. We then got the bruscetta platter, we ordered the basil, tomato,mozzarella, and the sun dried tomato with goat cheese. Both were very tasty. Then we moved on to the chicken sticks with lemon grass. Not my favorite. YES you CAN have too much lemongrass. I don't know if we'll go back to visit My Wine Cellar. I doubt it. At least we gave it the good college try.", "date": "2008-07-25 20:58:06"}

It's intimate, personable, and has a \"cheers\" atmosphere to it.  They sell wine by the glass and by the bottle, and the prices vary from reasonable to expensive.

They have some glassware as well, and some of it is really expensive...I saw a wine decanter for like $125!!  yikes. \n\nI reccomend this place for a variety of reasons.

Its a wonderfully relaxed enviroment, and its someplace you can go by yourself too, take a date, or just meet up with people for wine or beer.  clean, nice etc.  Its a wonderfully relaxing place to spend any evening.\n\nThe down side?  Don't bother eating here.  Stick to the wine when going.  Food here, I think, is okay, and overpriced.  Its a wine bar, not a resturant.  Also, I think they lack variety in things other then wines, like glassware which you can get at Ikea or Walmart anyways.\n\nPlus, the owner lady is always there.

Especially moving ones self...even if it is acoss town.\n\nAnyways, I had to get a 10 foot uhaul for my move from Chandler to Mesa.  I was moving a whopping 12 miles, but I just needed a 10 foot truck to do one trip with to get my mattress, bedroom furniture, couch, and other random stuff to the new apartment.  Fine.\n\nSo, I go in the night before I needed it and made a reservation for the truck.  Fine.  I go back the next morning, to get the truck, and this is where I get upset.  I'm already stressed out from moving, its hot as heck outside, and I want to get this overwith.  Im the only person in the store and its 8 AM.\n\nSo, I go to the counter.  A guy helps me, who's name I will not list in this review, even though I remember it.  He's filling out the stuff in the computer, and asks me for a secondary phone #.  I told him I did not have one, and the only one I have is my cell number. Well, I guess that was a huge problem to him, and he basically snapped at me and said \"look, I need a second phone number for you.  I'm just trying to fill out the paperwork!  Just give me your work number, okay?\"  \n\nCrap. Now I've been scolded by the uhaul man for not having a second phone #, and clearly this is really screwing up his day, really bad.   Now, I'm the bad guy.  So, what did I do?  I gave him a fax number.  Yea, call THAT and reach me.\n\nSo, then, they go to get me my truck.  Well, guess what?  It has no gas, because someone siphoned it out overnight! So the guy says to me \"did you want to wait for 15 minutes for me to gas the truck, or did you just want to take it empty?\"  Why would I want to drive a uhaul that has zero gas in it???  So I can be stranded a mile down the road, and make this day longer?????  So, I waited for him to gas it.\n\nNow, while I was waiting, and cranky counter man was gassing the truck up, two other employees waltz in.  I asked if they worked here, and they said that they are uhaul employees, but they are finance from corporate.  nice.  \n\nSee, I normally dont get mad, but I was so stressed from moving, and after getting scolded, I had to complain to someone.  So, I tell finance that counter boy is very cranky this morning and scolded me for not having a secondary phone number, and I dont appriciate it.  They were like \"uh, ok thanks.\"\n\nAnyways, cranky counterboy comes back with the truck, which was nice by the way.  Clean, fast, and most importantly, with gas!  I take the truck, move my stuff, and return it.  I think he got told that I complained becuase I got a few bucks off the dolly rental that I had....plus, he was in a MUCH better mood this time.\n\nI gave this place only 2 stars for the cranky counter boy.  But, the trucks were clean and neat.", "date": "2008-08-01 23:56:18"}

Every other time, the truck looks like a beast from the '80s with a thirst reserved for those travelling across the Sahara.\n\nThe only thing that lost a star here was the gas miser on the other end of the counter.  I always thought they left the gas needle somewhere between full and empty so as to confuse the next renter on trying to figure out how much gas to put in it to get it back exactly where it was when they return it.\n\nNot sure if this was unique to this UHaul location or all UHaul locations, but on the gas print out, it showed where the needle was and how much gas to put in it to get the needle back to that point at various locations along the gas gauge.  Spiffy!  Of course, later I would find that this was only spiffy in theory.\n\nUpon returning the truck, I stopped off at the local gas station, looked at my gauge, looked at the sheet....5.1 gallons.  Easy enough.  I proceed to pump about 5.25 gallons into the tank...just to be on the safe side.  Well the needle got up to about that mark but slightly under but I figured no big deal.  Well, as it turns out, it was a big deal.\n\nSo I got dinged for missing a gallon of gas and was promptly charged $9 bucks.  Awesome.  And I know that had I returned it with a gallon of extra gas I would not have received a $9 credit on my bill.\n\nOverall, it was one of the better UHaul experiences I've had and next time I'll be sure to just put an extra gallon or two over what the estimator thinks.", "date": "2011-09-07 19:10:20"}

Not that we're trying to get out quickly, but there's a point where it gets absurd. Here's a little example. P and I came in one rainy night around 7:30. It wasn't too busy and we found some nice, comfy seats and waited for a waitress to bring us some menus. And waited. And waited. Don't forget, they're not busy. Twenty minutes later a friendly waitress comes by (they're always friendly, haven't had a knowledgeable one yet, but they're always friendly) with some menus. Another ten or fifteen minutes she comes back to take our order. P had a question about one of the wines so the waitress offered her a taste of it. How nice! Another ten minutes she brought me my glass and P's taste and mentioned that they opened a bottle just for her taste. Unfortunately, P didn't like the wine at all (if I remember right, it was on the list in the wrong place, and P was looking for something much, much different) so instead of waiting again she russion-rouletted it and just ordered something. It came, we chatted and enjoyed our evening and she catches my eye and nods at the next table. it seems they have ordered the wine P didn't like and the waitress stands at the table popping the cork out with great flourish saying, \"here's the bottle of wine you ordered\". Why no one questioned it not needed to be uncorked, I don't know. It's a classy place like that though (underlying sarcasm). My Wine Cellar I mean. Not the poor suckers next to us paying top dollar for an opened bottle of wine with a pour missing from it. \n\nI guess I feel a sort of affection for My Wine Cellar. The same sort of affection you would feel for your \"special\" cousin. The one that can't seem to move out of your aunt and uncle's house and never seems to make smart life decisions.

My Wine Cellar gets creative with their dishes. I like trying out different things, so the small plates here let's me do so. I can get a little bit of everything and not waste so much food.\n\nThe ambience is elegant and pleasant. Not too loud either so you don't have to yell to have a conversation.\n\nService: \n\nStaff was friendly and the people at the wine bar welcome you with a smile right as you walk in. My friend comes here often so they knew her by name, which is nice that they appreciate their frequent customers. \n\nAppetizers:\n\n*Tempura cauliflower* crispy and served with a side sauce. \n\n*Bacon wrapped Dates* - served with a side of grapes, this appetizer is simple, yet tastes so gourmet. It's soaked in a maple sauce that pairs perfectly with the bacon. Even the grapes are drenched in the maple sauce. Yumminess. The dates are so creamy. I ate these with a knife and fork as they're piping hot when they're served. The bacon is crispy and slightly chewy. Not too thick or thin, wrapped securely around a slightly firm date that oozes out when you bite into it. \n\n*Cheese Platter* I ordered the asiago walnut cheese I believe which is a sharp cheddar cheese. The cheese comes out in cubes and is served with a couple slices of bread, olives, and their homemade jalape\u00f1o jam that is mouthwateringly delicious! \n\nWine:\n\nThey have specials everyday. They make their own blends of wine and from what I remember of what I had was a Red Blend of Zinfandel, Cabernet, and a few other different types of wine. It had a lovely peppery flavor to it. Not too sweet, which is what I look for in wine.\n\nI highly recommend this place for a girls night/date night. It's definitely a \"boujier\" and popular spot among locals. I'll definitely have to check out   a whole charcuterie board to share with a friend with some glasses of wine.", "date": "2018-09-27 05:14:13"}

Inside the colors are true to wine bar standards - on the dark side, encouraging to just let your tense shoulders relax. Lucy's place is a delightful find - a hard throw away from the trendy places you'll find in strip malls or in popular Scottsdale locations. In fact, it's nowhere near Scottsdale, nor does it pretend to be anything except what it is - a wine bar that offers you a wide selection, impeccable service and an atmosphere you aren't quick to leave. \n\nWhen I went, they had live acoustic music - a one man show playing the likes of Ryan Adams and Wilco. It was the perfect addition to a satisfying happy hour experience. \n\nPlus, Lucy has a couple small TVs hanging in view, in case you need to catch the baseball scores (it so happened to be turned onto the Red Sox game). \n\nI didn't want to leave.

I have mixed feelings about this Wine Bar, which is sad because I used to LOVE this spot ;/ I'am a frequent customer here and have been for many years. I bring a good amount of business to this place and I really feel like since new ownership/manager has changed to Stephanie this place just hasn't been the same. Zoya the previous owner/manager had a lot more events and was involved a lot more with the community. This was very important to many of the residents who live in the Awhatukee area and I see them now getting less business and return customers due to lack of activities and involvement with Phoenix. Example - current manager doesn't participate in AZ Restaurant Week. Zoya did every year and it was great deal for $33 and included a glass of wine of your choosing. This was always something myself and many girlfriends would look forward to in May and September every year. \n\nOne thing that really doesn't sit well with me is the communication or lack thereof. It seems this has been mentioned in several other reviews since management has changed. When you email them to make a reservation, ask a question or want details about something the response time is ridiculous (if you even get one). At least a week, if not more and when you respond back forget about receiving an answer especially if they don't like what you are requesting or don't have an answer. 100% of the time there are two people who will check/respond to emails Stephanie or Shannon Rush. \n\nWhen you have \"Weekly Happenings\" everyday of the week and it is switched up every month, please update your website or at least let your returning customers know about the updates/changes. Example - Tuesdays they have Blind Tastings. For the month of August it was Rose's and every month it is supposed to change to a different kind/type of wine. I called on August 31st and was told they do not do blind tastings on Tuesdays and I said yes you do, I just did one last Tuesday with some friends. The lady then responds with, \"well we don't know what's happening for the month of September yet\". I'm sitting here thinking to myself how am I telling the person who works there (mind you there is not many employees here, maybe slightly more than a handful) what there own restaurant is doing. This makes no sense and its the day before the month of September?!?! Terrible customer service!\n\nOverall, I really enjoy the food and the atmosphere, It is such a cute place (only reason I'm giving 3 stars), but will definitely be trying other places as I just don't get that same feeling when I'm there, where I look forward to coming back again ;/", "date": "2018-09-05 17:10:31"}

I waited for five more minutes and then requested my money back and as soon as I did, magically my order was ready. I took the refund and the food, but I will never return.

The work is second to none, and Kathy goes above and beyond to deliver.  Let me give you my most recent experience...\n\nI referee High School football weeknights and weekends.  I took my only pair of football pants into Kathy for some alterations and was scheduled to pick them up Friday morning before my game that evening.  Well, as it turned out, Thursday morning I was assigned a last minute JV game for that evening and of course I needed my pants.  Kathy was not in the office, nor were my pants, but I was assured a message would be passed along and Kathy would contact me.  No longer than 30 mins passed when I got a phone call from Kathy who assured me I would have my pants no later than 4pm.  Kathy drove half way across Phoenix to pick up my pants and bring them back to Ahwatukee for me to pick up an entire day before I was scheduled to.  Not once did she seem irritated or annoyed with me.  She made me feel like family.  Reasons like this are exactly why I will continue taking all of my alteration needs to Kathy, and why you should too!", "date": "2015-10-23 15:07:03"}

I gave this rating two stars, as I usually award-2 for service, 2 for food, and the 5th star for overall experience and desire to return. \n\nI walked in late Monday morning (not busiest time) and said hello to the lady at the counter and toddler next to her. I always smile but did not get any eye contact when I explained I had never been in before and was excited to try it. I asked how it works...where to order etc. I wanted to enjoy the rainy weather with a new book and eat in. But she mumbled something and went to make coffee, the little girl played with the register and money. (Cricket, cricket) Then I asked the toddler if her name was Bonnie and she said naa, so much for my icebreaker. About 5 minutes pass and the server (Gina displayed on receipt) came back to take my order and at that time I decided to get it to go. I ordered the nutella/banana/strawberry crepe and a mocha, which she said would be \"up in like 2 minutes\". Wow that is FAST, how impressive and I wasn't in any hurry. I awkwardly shifted around the entrance and back wall trying to find a place to stand as the next 25 minutes rolled by. When I stood in back she told me my coffee was up front...which scolded my tongue ouch! I said it is so hot I burned my tongue and would like a couple ice cubes. Yet again no eye contact or comment and she poured in 2 ice cubes. Let me just say I love my coffee but damn that hurt! I also understand fresh quality food isn't instantaneous but would have appreciated a realistic estimate. After trying the crepe I realized it's not my favorite food as I don't like warm bananas and strawberries-no stars taken off that is just my personal taste. \n\nMy philosophy is I'm spending money at a local business, welcome me and give me the run down. I did not feel welcome at all. It's not difficult to glance up with a smile and acknowledge a NEW customer to make a good first impression. This is an adorably quaint restaurant and although small it would have been a great place for small meetings. I watched 2 couples come in while I waited and they were not greeted warmly either.

Not like ones you get in London or Paris, or even Seattle for that matter. But for suburban Phoenix they are great. My guess is it is the ingredients.

I've had most of the \"cupz\" offerings as well and they are all good, hot or cold. My kids like the Italian sodas. \n\nI wish they had a bigger patio with a better view than the parking lot, but it is a strip mall and they do well with what they have. The decor is cute \"Paris\" without being over the top and they have books and coloring for the kids. They also have a couch area with a TV for any catching critical sporting events that might be on. \n\nThe business level is unpredictable.

They've got a lot of crepes. A crepe is like soft tortilla without a lot of flavor. You put stuff in it, and eat it, and the crepe works with basically anything because it's not a strong taste. So we had a chicken crepe, a BLT crepe, and a PBJ crepe. All were great, and all very different experiences.\n\n2. This place is pretty cool in terms of being friendly and family friendly. The waitresses were cool, and did a lot to help keep my tiny, tiny son entertained.\n\n3. It's not super fast, but it's not super slow either. And it's popular. We showed up, there were no open tables, and there were people waiting in like for coffee or something like that.

The savory crepes are similar to each other except for the turkey pesto and italian. Turkey pesto is unforgivingly salty but the others seem true to their description. The sweet crepes are a delight and they have a good variety whether you are craving a lighter fruit crepe or chocolate drenched or a mix there is one for you. I enjoy the strawberry, kiwi and honey as well as the sunshine. One crepe rarely fills me though so the bill ends up being expensive since I get one of each.\nCoffee and italian soda here are also quite good but I wouldn't say it is to die for.

It looks like they just opened. First of all, I am a crepe fan, and I honestly think they can do better. I came with that expectation because food at restaurants isn't always satisfactory, and I've stopped going out for a long time.  I ordered a Veggie Delight (I'm a vegetarian/vegan), and it had baby spinach, red onion, tomatoes and feta cheese, and it wasn't fully wrapped and there was too much feta cheese. I like a crepe where everything's stuffed in-nothing spilled out on the ends. I liked their simple selection of ingredients-I would have liked to see more vegetarian options. They do have the \"create your own crepe\" option, but I wasn't in the right mood to invent my own crepe. It costs $3.50 for a crepe with 1 topping and for every meat you add, it's 1.00 and savory & cheese for .75. If I really made the effort to design my own crepe, I would have ordered spinach and swiss, and it would have been slightly cheaper than the Veggie Delight (it cost $5.25) for less ingredients.\n\nIf I could come here again, I would try the breakfast crepe and sweet crepe when I need my sweet fix. And maybe that'll change my rating. :)\n\nI like the design and decor of the cafe-a nice mixture homey 'n' modern feel to it-loove the wooden fans. Doesn't ave alot of character, but there are several old-french style decor. The open celings with metal covers are cool. It is very spacious, and there are several black plush chairs and lots of tables and chairs. I would come here to study since they have free WIFI here, and you can find comfort here.\n\nI ordered iced chai with soy milk, and it was surprisedly good-most places don't make it right!\n\nLastly, the customer service is greeeat-as soon as I sat down, a waitress came up to me and asked what I wanted to order-you would think this cafe is a typical one where you go to the bar and take your order, but this is also a restaurant setting where they serve you.\n\nIf not for crepes, I'd def recommend this place for a hang-out and a sip of coffee with friends if you want to steer away from the devli's brew for yuppies.

I was excited to try another non-chain resturant, and really wanted to like this place! \n\nWe walked in, and noticed the sign to seat yourselves. We were looking around the room for a table when, without even so much as a \"Hi\" or, \"How are you\", the waitress gruffly tells us her only table is outside. Okay, sorry. So we grabbed our menus and silverware and headed outside. \n\nApproximately 10 minutes later we order water and coffee, boyfriend gets a ham and cheese crepe, I order a cream cheese and strawberry crepe. After quite a long wait the food comes out, and my crepe has no cream cheese, just plain strawberries and whipped cream. When I ask the waitress about it (nicely!)- thinking maybe they'd just made a mistake, she quite rudely says \"You didn't order a cream cheese crepe\" then invents a ficticious conversation where she had asked me if I wanted \"just whipped cream and strawberries\", and I said yes...  Despite the fact that that conversation never happened (she hardly said two words to us when we ordered!), my boyfriend AND the people at the table next to us heard me order the cream cheese and strawberry crepe. Plus, I don't even think there's an option on the menu for just a whipped cream and strawberry crepe...\n\nThere were no offers to correct the mistake, no apology, nothing. Just an accusation that I didn't know what I ordered, and what did I want her to do about it... Also not a single offer of a refill of water or coffee throughout the meal. Not wanting to sit there for another 20 minutes to wait for our check, boyfriend went inside to pay. Again, that took about 10 minutes because despite having three people behind the counter, not a single person acknowledged him. \n\nWOW! I will admit the food was pretty good (although I really was craving the strawberries and cream cheese...). But we will not be back- because of the service!", "date": "2012-05-05 20:30:10"}

Both breakfast and lunch varieties are available during open hours which is nice because I arrived at 10:30am but wanted a lunch crepe.\n\nI will be back for a sweet crepe that is for sure!", "date": "2017-03-18 00:56:43"}

Service has never been fabulous but not worth complaining about until it went out-of-bounds bad today.\nToday, a friend and I sat and waited literally 30 minutes before anyone would even bring us water.  This was after my friend had to get up and ask someone at the counter to please come serve us.  Even after that, there was an uncomfortable time lapse before we even got the water!  Then, when the waitress finally came over for our order, my friend politely informed her how long we had waited to even be acknowledged and we were only rewarded with intense attitude/denial and no apology!  One apology if she hadn't seen us or felt overwhelmed would have gone a long way - I get it, but nothing.  We watched her serve all of the other tables food (most of which had arrived after us) before we even had some water!  It was so bad that I started to wonder if the waitress could possibly have something personally against us that I was completely unaware of but that's crazy, right??\nSo, no validation, no apology, no comp on the bill, no vindication, (except perhaps this review) just a fear that there was waitress spit in my crepe or water... \nDon't waste your time here.", "date": "2016-06-15 02:28:53"}

However, the owner recognizes the regulars and builds good rapport with them, a serious plus in my mind.  As far as the coffee goes, it's the best place in Ahwatukee if you're a chain-hater like me.

There's wifi and both times I went (noonish-2), it was fairly empty.  Our lady server was nice and had great recommendations. Our crepes took a little more than five minutes! Again, it was not busy. \n\nThe ingredients are kept to a minimum. From the pictures, I thought I wouldn't like it because the crepes looked tough and like tortillas. \n\nI was wrong. They are soft and fluffy. I DID avoid the turkey crepes though bc I don't like how the the slabs of processed turkey looks in the photos. I tried four crepes total.\n\nCream cheese and jelly (sweet). I chose apricot jelly. Although this only has two ingredients, they didn't skimp. SO much filling. The cream cheese was nice and warm and the jelly oozed over it. It tasted almost buttery. So, so good and simple. \n\nThe Shirley (sweet). This has chocolate sauce (probably Nutella), strawberries, cream cheese and whipped cream. So, so sweet. Too much chocolate sauce for me. \n\nThe Sunflower (sweet). This is basically like a parfait in a crepe. I was surprised at how fresh the ingredients are. Yogurt was just right, and the four different kinds of berries were fresh! Even the granola was crunchy. A+. \n\nCheese, mushroom and avocado (savory). You get to pick your cheese! So good. Again, fresh ingredients. \n\nOverall, consistently warm crepes and fresh ingredients. That's all you need! Oh, the pomegranate green tea deserves mention. Large size tea for less than 2$!

Went on on a Thursday morning about 830am, the place was about half full.  Charming decor as my friend had told me,  sadly that is where the joy ended.  I waited literally 15 minutes in this very small cafe like setting to be greeted.  Watched the server come and go around me and not once did she say \"I'll be right with you\"  or anything to acknowledge my existence.  Which certainly I appreciate when I see a server struggling,  \"in the weeds' or dealing with another party per say. Another table that sat 5 minutes after me was greeted first, received their drinks, and then I was greeted with no mention as to any delay.  I ordered an avocado, tomato crepe w no cheese.  It was fine, rather bland and I ordered salsa to help it achieve some much needed flavor.  The waitress never mentioned that I pay at the front register so I waited quite a long time with my credit card on the table waiting to have it ran, as that is the typical process for most sit down cafes/restaurants. Finally when I figured it out I went to the front and asked for a to go cup for my tea from the server,  I then  proceeded to wait as the server went to take other orders while I stood at the register waiting for a to go cup...  Overall it wasn't terrible,  but other than the fact that it's decor is adorable and it offers a vast selection of crepes,  I would not make an effort to return due to the poor service and less than phenomenal crepes.", "date": "2016-03-01 06:26:03"}

When we reminded her, she apologized and, to her credit, brought us a fruit bowl. The crepes came out 5 mins later.\n\nAfter we ate, she brought us the check for full price. I asked her if we can get anything taken off because of the messed up coffee order and the long wait. She said that was why she gave us the free fruit bowl... but she would do something for us. Then, she came back with the revised bill, taking off one crepe ($5). Instead of arguing, I resigned myself to paying it and posting this review.\n\nAgain, I wish this were a one-time thing, but you need to know what you expect when you come here - decent food and terrible service. I also wish that there was a better place to get crepes in the east valley. I guess next time we'll try that place in Tempe.", "date": "2016-11-06 19:23:01"}

We talked about going there for quite awhile since it's just around the corner from where we live. Finally, last Saturday, after an early jaunt to the dog park, the boy and I decided to have a nice little brunch date. The place was fairly empty and we were surprised to find it was full table service. We were prepared to order at the counter and then sit. The decor was really cute and the atmosphere was really nice. The waitress was a little bit abrasive, and not my favorite, but we ordered lattes and a couple of sweet crepes, read the Ahwatukee Foothills News and just enjoyed some pleasant conversation. We both went with sweet crepes, the Strawberry, Nutella and Whipped Cream. I've never been to France and I've not traveled the world over so I'm not going to tell you about how inferior their crepes are to those I've enjoyed in Paris, so I think they were good. I guess they're a little on the thick side, from what I've heard about crepes, but it created a good balance with how much filling they put in them. This past Saturday we had friends stay over and they wanted to go as well, so we went again for the second Saturday in a row. This week there was apparently some sort of Senior Olympics, so 90% of the tables were pushed together for them, fine whatever. So we were sat and brought menus, and not two seconds after the first waitress walked away, the same woman as the last time came over and said \"are you ready to order?\". I felt kind of rude but she was so I guess no harm, no foul, but I just said \"She literally JUST brought us the menus\". So she went away for 30 seconds and was back. Then we ordered coffee, 1 min later she was back with the coffee and very clearly ready for our order. We were half way through giving our order when this group of 3 other diners who were apparently regulars and favorites of the waitress felt that they should interject and begin joking about the waitress not already knowing their order, she of course obliged, and eventually returned to taking our order. We ordered a breakfast crepe each and then two sweet crepes to share. She informed us that she was just going to bring them all out together because that other large group was going to be ordering too. It was obvious what they were trying to do was squeeze us in really quick before the large group of senior bicyclists weeded their kitchen for 20 mins. That's cool, I get it, but it could have been done a bit more gracefully. I had the Ham, Egg and Pepper Jack cheese crepe, which was really good. The ham seemed to be really good quality. One saving grace of the waitress was that she had the forethought to put the whipped cream on the side of the sweet crepes so that it wasn't a melted mess by the time we were ready to eat them. Everything was tasty yet again, but I still think their service could use some work, or maybe I just need to work on being \"a chosen one\". We'll probably go back once in a while, we'll just try to avoid senior bike race day from now on. (Nothing against senior bicyclists of course)", "date": "2011-03-07 06:12:59"}

The Nutella crepe was by far the best, although the use of ready whip and Hershey's syrup took away from the Nutella, wish they had made their own products. The cinnamon sugar crepe was by far the worst, having almost no flavor.

We loved everything we tried. Had the turkey pesto, which was our favorite. The lady that waited on us was super nice and friendly (short brown hair and glasses). Really cute decor, would be a great spot to just go and have coffee as well. Also amazing prices, less than $7 per crepe and we did not leave hungry. \n\nWent back again a few days later for breakfast. They were really slow (the waitress warned us and we were in no hurry so we didn't mind, but just FYI if you are trying to get in and out quickly on a Sunday). Again, had the same waitress from the couple days before who was super nice. She wasn't great about drink refills or checking after we got our food, but she seemed to be waiting on every single table in the place, bussing the tables and making  drinks so I don't blame her - seems just like they need to hire a few more people. She seems to be the one keeping this place moving so kudos to her! There was another with waitress with tattoos (nothing against them, just what I remembered) who was rude to almost everyone who walked in, even when they were friendly with her. She seemed to do about 25% of the work (not sure if any table was actually solely hers), while ours did the other 75%. The breakfast crepes we had were really blan with not a lot of flavor - crepe itself was just as good as the first time, but the filling lacked anything exciting. We had the ham, egg and cheese (had to put salt, pepper and hot sauce on it before I even wanted to finish eating it), my mom had the tomato, spinach, egg and cheese (spinach was not saut\u00e9ed and was cold). Again both really blan. \n\nGreat place to go with girlfriends. \n\nIn conclusion, I probably won't return for breakfast, but will return frequently for lunch!", "date": "2014-03-31 01:07:06"}

Why is that you ask? Because SoCal sets the standard. This may be an unfair advantage but I'd like to think, I've come across the best or at least above average places that I'd like to see duplicated out here. \n\nI recently visited this cafe for lunch. The menu online was not as diverse as I'd hope. But the fact that a crepes cafe exists in the East Valley was enough for me to trek out to Ahwatukee for the afternoon. I didn't know what to expect from Ahwatukee since I never go out in that direction. It didn't have the same flavor of La Creperie in Long Beach but that is downtown Long Beach and it's where diversity lives and breathes. Tucked away in a strip mall, this little cafe stood out among the other stores/restaurants with it's signage and decor. It was a friendly cafe that seemed inviting for a casual meal and laid back ambiance. \n\nI ordered the veggie delight and I tried with all my might to really like it. There was nothing special about it. It was dry from the spinach to the tomato down to the cheese. Absolutely dry. No sauce or flavor. My friend also ordered off the \"savory lunch menu\" and felt her meal was bland as well. We wanted to like it but it just wasn't what we had in mind. \n\nI gave the cafe 3 stars because the owner was very patient with us as we took our time ordering. The chai was good not stellar but good. And overall the experience was fine. I just hope that they put the \"savory\" aspect back in the meals by adding a little sauce or flavor to the dishes. This place has great potential and it would be ashamed to see the only local crepes place disappear like most businesses in the East Valley.", "date": "2010-06-26 23:41:02"}

I love coffee and I love crepes! It was not meant to be though (...yet). I think if they made a couple changes, they'd be alright. And, I will try them again after a while to see if they've improved. But for now, I'll stay away.\n\nChange 1- The crepes themselves are chewy. Crepes are not supposed to be chewy...at least not that chewy. I've never NEEDED a knife with a crepe before. I've used a knife with a crepe before, but it was absolutely essential here. I'm not a chef, but my guess is too much stirring of the batter creates too much gluten, which means way too chewy crepes (?). I know that's true with pancake batter at least.\n\nChange 2- Without advertising the fact, they used some sort of non-fat or skim milk in their espresso drinks (I ordered an Iced Mocha). I think a little bit of fat (like whole milk) works best in espresso drinks. I would have at least liked the option, but it was not stated anywhere, nor were we asked about type of milk we wanted. Worse yet, they used a cheap brand of milk (or it was expiring?). Bad.\n\nGood points: The fillings of the crepes were actually delicious (otherwise I wouldn't even consider coming back). The turkey, the pesto, the avocado, all delicious! My sis ordered a sweet crepe, and that was also delicious...well, the inside of it anyway. The atmosphere was also nice. I wasn't expecting it to be so 'chic' inside (like I really know what chic is). But, it was both modern & relaxing inside. The service was mostly friendly too...after a rough start.**\n\nBad Points: Chewy crepes. Low quality milk. **The beginning of our service was weird. I hate when people who work places treat you like you should know how THEY do things even when it's your first time there. You ever pick up on that vibe some place? I didn't even know if you order first or sit first, and they were staring at us like, \"What's your problem?\" Uhh...I don't know what to do; that's my problem! How about welcoming me to your establishment and telling me to have a seat or place my order. They turned into sweethearts after we were seated, but it was a startling introduction.\n\nBottom line: I will try them again eventually perhaps, but I'm in no rush at this point.", "date": "2009-02-10 21:14:14"}

Cahill landscaping definitely lived up to their online reputation. Jeremy responded to my phone call promptly, he presented himself with professionalism, provided an estimate when he said he would and always responded to my emails and texts. The pictures I sent him didn't represent the work well enough, especially the size of the tree to be removed, so he had to add a little extra on for removing it. He told me this long before the work began and did a complete and thorough job before asking to be paid. He even did a little extra work for us smoothing out an area under some pavers we had removed. It probably only took a few extra minutes but we appreciated the extra touch. The only negative was that he said he would come between 6:30 & 7 and didn't get there until 8 but he did let me know at 6:30 that he would be there at 8 so he still gets 5 stars.\n\n I would give him another star for extra credit if I could. He checked in with my wife multiple times to make sure she was happy with the work inspite of having not previously meet her and only working with me so far. The landscaping work was meant to make my wife happy and he helped me acheive my goal. We will be using him again and referring him to our customers.", "date": "2015-06-10 13:15:25"}

My lovable, well behaved dog was refused service by the company. During my consultation for a dog walker, I requested that my dog remain on his leash at all times outside of our home. I explained that our neighbor had put a complaint in to animal control for being off leash near our front yard. It was not a formal complaint or a fine. The representative that came to our door simply said not to worry about anything, but that because they had to follow up on every complaint, just to make sure to keep him on a leash at all times. I was told that due to liability reasons, they cannot give services to any dog that has had any association with animal control. I read through all of the company's fine print and it did not mention the words animal control at all. It did, however, say that they do not provide service to animals that they deem aggressive. I sincerely hope that the refusal of service has nothing to do with his breed. Unfortunately, my sweet pittie mix Rocky, has dealt with breed discrimination far too often. The company's owner left a message with the news and said that they would leave our key under our mat, however the paperwork did say the company would never leave or hide keys on our property. This is just a heads up to anyone who went through a situation like ours, so you hopefully will not go through the disappointment that our family did.", "date": "2015-04-14 21:52:42"}

I had no hesitation getting the membership after seeing how great the experience was. Lisa is my go-to, but I've had a few of the ladies trim my hair at this point. All exceptional. \n\nSolid 5 star location and concept.", "date": "2017-09-19 18:47:44"}

But first: For starters while living in Kansas I remember thinking to myself years ago \"man I wish I could pay once a month and just keep my hair trimmed.\" Fast forward, I move back to AZ and BOOM an idea a reality. I don't want to take credit, but I mean, come on... . The price is stupid reasonable especially if you get your hair cut 2 times a month or more. I've had all the stylists I think at one point or another but I have landed on Lisa as the winner. All have been great but Lisa just has chemistry with clients that can't be taught. I use the app every 2 weeks and check to see if Lisa is working. If she is I grab a slot and conveniently walk in at the time selected for no wait time. And finally, THIS IS HUGE: I often have to bring my 2 kiddos with me. Every employee (except one which I won't name out of respect) embraces my kiddos and doesn't mind letting them run in circles and climb on an empty chair. I'm sure that's against policy, but knowing I can get my haircut and not feel a passive aggressive tension is awesome. I love that they embrace the kids. Overall, killer place. However I'm moving to East Mesa/North QC soon and hope y'all open on Gilbert so I can keep my membership", "date": "2017-07-16 01:47:16"}

I actually love the Tukee shop as it's just a few minutes from home. It's in a great location and all of the barbers here are super friendly. Chris is the man and gets it right every time. True professional. I've also had Lisa cut my hair at this location and she's excellent with attention to detail. Highly recommend this Keep it Cut Location as well!", "date": "2018-10-08 19:53:54"}

Pricey but professional and the AC works great. I always get a short haircut as Yelp check ins show however some places do this cut in a fast aggressive manner. Keep it Cut took their time and it was pleasant. As a note it would be cool to have some more variety in reading magazines in the waiting area. I recommend Keep it cut.", "date": "2017-09-19 13:59:08"}
