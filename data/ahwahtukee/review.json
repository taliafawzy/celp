Randy came over on short notice and did an amazing job. He was prompt, pleasant and extremely honest. We had told him to not to worry about the carpeting on the stairs as that was going to be replaced. He said he could try to get the stains out and save us money replacing the carpet. I was willing to have him do that, but then on closer examination, he said that it would be better to replace it, resulting in a lower total for him. A less honest carpet cleaning might not have done that. He also did not try to upsale anything, and before he pretreated the pet stains, he told me how much it would be and allowed me to confirm the new pricing. The end total was affordable and fit the expectations he had set at the beginning, so no surprise fees or charges. The carpets smell and look beautiful. I will recommend him to friends and family and will keep his card should I need his services in the future. I highly recommend Horton Carpet Cleaning, and I'm glad to see that he has such high reviews on Yelp.", "date": "2015-06-08 18:01:45"}

He really went above and beyond what I expected and truly saved the day.  My carpet looks great and it really feels and smells clean and like new. I highly recommend him.

He showed up on time, completed a walk-through and was very thorough in the cleaning of the carpets in our condo in Chandler.
