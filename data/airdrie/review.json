My first impression of this place was less than stellar. First off there was a group of somewhat shady looking men smoking right outside the entrance. After walking through the cloud of smoke we entered the somewhat desolate looking bar. It was a Wednesday evening and mostly empty except for what looked to be a few regulars who stared at us when we came in like we didn't belong there. I also noticed that the layout of the bar was kind of odd without much flow and had a bit of a dirty look to it.\n\nWe quickly found a table and the waitress was prompt getting our drinks, though they were all out of the beer that was supposed to be on special. Also for a place called \"pour beer market\" I was underwhelmed with the beer selection. We then decided to take a look at the menu and my appetite was kind of turned off by the dirty menu. We ordered the nachos since there really wasn't much that appealed to us on the menu and nothing really unique. The nachos were your standard pub nachos, nothing to complain about there. We decided against ordering any more beer since we just weren't enjoying the atmosphere and the weird dance music.\n\nAll in all I would not return.", "date": "2017-10-11 16:11:52"}

What I got with the first bite of my second half is what this review is about. \n\nI bit into the sandwich and got a mouthful of grizzle and fat so I popped open the sandwich after spitting my bite out and pulled out a huge chunk of fat. My Hubs (not being as picky as me) thought I was over exaggerating and went to eat it and what he got he had to spit out as well.\n\nAfter sending it back, someone (I am assuming a shift manager, she didn't introduce herself) came out and asked what was wrong with it. I explained my complaint and she said the kitchen staff had examined the carnage and agreed it was sub par.  I told her I was shocked that any person with half a brain would send something of this poor quality out of the kitchen, let alone expect a paying guest to consume it. She offered me 50% off my sandwich as a gesture of their apology. I laughed a little (while just shaking my head) because I didn't feel like arguing about it, but what if I had taken that half to eat first? Unfortunately she affected our servers tip and I believe she owes our server the difference. \n\nSo, I will \"take\" your 50% off the sandwich (a lousy apology, by the way, for my disturbing experience) and I will \"see\" you one review.\n\nSee you \"never\"!", "date": "2014-10-19 22:40:11"}

The reason for my visit was that I had been experiencing unusual cold-like symptoms that were severe and prolonged. \n\nWhen I arrived I was prompted by a sign near triage stating that I had to stop behind a red line and wait until a triage nurse could see me. My fianc\u00e9 and I stood there for 20 minutes, all the while, two nurses and an administrative worker stood at a desk chatting a meter away from us. For those 20 minutes we listened to them complain about patients, co-workers and their personal lives without any kind of acknowledgement that we were even stood there. Meanwhile, a line behind us started to form which included elderly people and families with young children. When they finally finished their conversations a nurse called me over to her desk to promptly tell me that it was a 4 hour wait, I said that it was no problem as I was in a considerable amount of pain. She checked my vitals, filled a chart and had me register with the administrative staff. \n\nI proceeded to wait three and a half hours until I was called up (which is not my concern, we live in a large city with many surrounding communities and wait times add up), when I was called it was a new nurse who quickly tried to usher me into another area to be looked at by a doctor and when I could not keep up, she barked at me saying, \"that chair in the back, go sit there\" and did not acknowledge me further. \n\nAfter another 20 minutes a young doctor came to see me, he asked about my history, checked my ears, throat, glands and head. Told me it was a common cold, to drink plenty of fluids and take some advil. He also mentioned that he noticed that I had been swabbed for strep throat two months prior and that he felt he didn't need to test again for it because of this and sent me home. \n\nToday, Monday, June 5th 2017 I decided to see another doctor for a second opinion. He did all the same tests and immediately prescribed me an antibiotic to treat my symptoms, which turns out was strep throat as well as an ear infection. \n\nI am thoroughly disappointed with the treatment I received at Airdrie urgent care, I understand that being a health services professional is a difficult job that requires a lot from a person, but I was not treated with any decency or respect from any of the staff working on this occasion. For patients to wait hours on end to see a doctor, only to receive less than 5 minutes of a doctors time and be sent home with no answers is a shame. I would recommend that AHS not only trains their staff to better treat and respect their patients, but also how to behave in the workplace in general. Lunchroom gossip needs to be saved for the lunchroom, not the front desk where 20+ people can hear you and are waiting to be served. In addition, I would recommend that for patients (who are usually in pain/miserable/exhausted as is from whatever is ailing them) be treated with some kind of courtesy or kindness from AHS staff in order to provide a positive experience for both parties. I saw several young families come through those doors with injured and sick little ones who were treated the exact same way I was, and the waiting room was filled with chatter of how disappointing the treatment from staff was. Lastly, Doctors need to be able to either have more time or more patience in order to better diagnose and recommend treatment for their patients; having two visit two doctors offices in a 24 hour period is not enjoyable and much of my ordeal could have been avoided if the doctor who saw me at Airdrie Urgent Care had actually taken the time to do his job properly.", "date": "2017-06-06 04:14:54"}

Alyssa, the same hair stylist was getting behind, actually had to leave me there waiting as she went to do a haircut for another client, and that's how it was almost 4 hours, her jumping between other people fixing their cuts or color. It was close to closing hour and one lady she was working on, was still sitting under the dryer with the color correction on. She run out of time to trim my hair so she hacked it here and there. I went home and the hair just would not line up in layers, the rough hacking was just there on both sides of my head different length. Never mind the color, greenish gray, mousy color. \nWent back to the salon and talked to the owner, right away she was defensive, told me to \"work with her \", as far as appointment time for fixing it, and she said she would try to \"squize me in\" on Saturday. Told her I have already been \"squizzed\" and told her how the stylist was jumping from client to client when she was doing my color. We agreed on Saturday appt. I went there, she wanted to hot iron my hair first, I said I would preffer no to  hot iron. Then she started dry cut my hair, and finally suggested I go somewhere else, she would give me my money back. I said it was a good idea. \nShe however gave me back just the money for the haircut and refused the color money. As I demended the full refund, she thretened me with the police, grabbing the phone.

The assortment of items on their menu had my mouth watering as I read over the menu online.  I'd heard chatterings about Wok Box and when I finally looked it up I noted locations only in the South or Airdrie (I completely somehow missed the Kincora location in the North).  \n\nHubs was out of town one night for a boys night away.  I didn't want to cook so I took the kids out to eat.  Without too much arm twisting or wrestling, I talked them into trying out Wok Box in Airdrie as it's really not that far of a drive once you hop on the Deerfoot.  We must have arrived pre-dinner rush as we were the only ones in the place for the first 10 minutes or so.  We decided on 4 dishes total to share, kung pao chicken with chow mein noodles, chicken pad thai with ribbon noodles and 2 kids dishes....jungle chow mein noodles with veggies and breaded crispy chicken on rice.  I asked how big the non kid dishes were and I was told the size of the large take out box.  Seemed fine at the time and leftovers would be welcomed.\n\nThe portions came up at the pick up area and 2 of them were larger than life.  We ended up with a ton of food...so no complaints there.  Unfortunately it became quite obvious the chicken had been precooked and been sitting for awhile since even tossed in with the kung pao & pad thai dishes it was dry and lacked seasoning & flavour.  The chow mein noodles had also been precooked and did not taste like any chow mein noodle I've ever had before.  The flavours of these 2 dishes were just OK.  The kids jungle chow mein noodles were supposed to come with veggies but we only found a few veggies (cut up bok choy or celery) on the bottom of the bowl.  The rice was not fluffy but sticky as though it was not cooked properly.  The breaded crispy chicken was the best tasting of the meal.  My daughter asked for a order of Naan bread so we also got some.  Sadly it was a very small portion compared to the cost.  I let the kids enjoy it and did not get to taste it since there really wasn't enough for 3 of us.\n\nThe prices were fair overall, the place very clean and the employees friendly.   I still want to love this place and may give a different location another go in the future.", "date": "2013-02-04 21:38:47"}

I lived in Houston TX for nearly 3 years, and being a Latino myself I was a frequent patron on all nearby Mexican restaurants. The food is simply great. It has that home made flavour that you cannot find on Taco Bell, or even on that fashionista mexican restaurant in downtown. Food is fresh, tasty, and the cook and owner are Mexican... so they know their stuff. In another review I read a guy complaining about the red sauce. Well, this is not your typical Mexican red sauce from Old El Paso, this is a Chile de Arbol Salsa, honestly, I've never tried it before and it was shocking when I tasted it, as I was expecting the regular bland red salsa. But once I learned it was a different salsa, I gave it a second try and I loved it. It has an aged, strong flavour that will make you think of tequila or vodka. Better if you have it with the food, as will be very dominant with tortillas alone. My partner ordered Tacos Dorados (chicken) and she was in love with them (and she is very hard to impress). I ordered Tacos de Costilla (beef) and although the presentation wasn't great, I'm still craving them the day after. Yes, the portions are a bit small, yes, there are kids jumping around, yes, the presentation is not very elaborated, but what the heck... it doesn't get more authentic mexican than this. Even if you go to mexico every 2 months, don't think that the food they serve over there is authentic.... is just tourist approved. Tacos Puerto Vallarta is probably the best authentic mexican food I've tasted in the last 10 years.", "date": "2013-09-10 17:03:31"}

You can also get a half chicken or \"hot links\" sausage (Kielbassa).   I liked the links but found the smoked casings a bit hard to cut - if you like the sausage 'snap', you'll love these.  They happened to be out of chicken but it's ok we'll get some next time.\n\nSides are extra but reasonable and include the usual coleslaw and beans but more spectacular the homemade mac and cheese and sweet smoked corn - these were beautiful.\n\nOur ordering approach (since we didn't see a sampler) was to order several meats and sides and just shared - between 4 adults this worked out great, we came away stuffed and bill (food only) came to under $70 which seemed pretty reasonable.\n\nThe good folks from Half Hitch brewery in Cochrane were trolling around giving out samples of their Farmers Daugher Pale Ale which went nicely with the BBQ...\n\nDecore/ambiance fit the venue with lots of TV including 2 monster screens.  Staff were friendly, relaxed and in good humour, joking with our table - the assistant manager brought us into the kitchen for a quick look at their smokers, already full of the next days goodness.\n\nWell done Main Street, best of luck...will be looking forward to our next visit...\n\nCheers", "date": "2016-09-25 18:16:47"}

I live maybe 30 minutes from Airdrie and they wouldn't pick me up, so I guess the slogan \"Enterprise,  we'll pick you up\" should really be \"Enterprise, we'll pick you up as long as it's less than 30 minutes away\"\nAnyway,  I needed a truck to rent to replace my truck that was stolen and my insurance lady told me Enterprise would call me within 30 minutes to an hour to make arrangements.  No one called. I contacted them the next day and they said they had a car I could pick up. I said I don't want a car, I NEED a truck. My 4 kids are in a BMX program and I need to transport bikes and my one kid is in a band and plays drums and I need to move drums and other band equipment.  They said they would have a truck the next day.  I waited.  No one called the next day, I called them the following day, Saturday but they were closed by 12:00pm. Monday comes, still no call back, I call them.  I'm told they'll make some calls to arrange a truck. (And they were well aware that I need 3/4 ton not a 1/2 ton) Nobody calls back. Tuesday I call them and they tell me to come on Thursday.  Now at this point I've been without my vehicle for a week.  I go there on Thursday and they tell me they have a Kia car for me.  (Wtf!) I reminded them I NEED a truck. Apparently they had a truck there but it needed an oil change so I couldn't have it.  They try to convince me that's it a really nice Kia but it still doesn't work for what I need. So I took it anyway because I need a vehicle and was told by the next day (Friday) or Saturday by closing they'll have a truck for me. So they actually called me back on Friday  (imagine my surprise) and said I can come Saturday and get a truck.  (Woo hoo) so I double check that the truck will be an equivalent to my f250 that was stolen and capable of pulling a small trailer because I'm in the process of moving stuff from a farm I had items stored at into a storage bay because the farm sold and my friends were moving so I had to move my stuff ASAP, and Enterprise was well aware,  I made it clear many times that I need 3/4 ton, not a 1/2 ton and they said no, we have this dodge1500 for you. Well f*#*! That doesn't do me any good.  So long story short, I switched to a different company,  I'm now working through Budget and within 15 minutes of dealing with them at budget I'll be able to pick up a truck that meets my need on Monday morning. Dealing with a theft and insurance is stressful enough and the people at Enterprises just majority added to the headache and frustration.", "date": "2017-07-15 19:28:07"}

There were only two other tables full while we dined. The menus were shabby pieces of paper. My fiance did not care for his spaghetti and meatballs. They were extremely bland.

Tony's is no exception.\n\nOnly open for a few weeks at the time of this review, I've both dined in and done take-out at Tony's. The first night, we sat in. The location is a bit out of the way for a lot of people, and you might get lost if you don't know the area - Tony's is located in a more industrial part of town, and takes up one of the bays in an commercial condo building. That being said, it's nice and big with lots of breathing room - there are high ceilings, bright walls, and GIGANTIC booths - ours was pre-set for 4, but could comfortably hold 6-8 people with no issues. If anything, parking was the hardest part, as, despite this being in an industrial area, there's a fitness center in another nearby unit, so there's plenty of activity at both the restaurant and gym around dinner time. \n\nOnto the food! The menu is pretty large, and worth checking out. Lots of the standard fare, so I opted to go with the Vermicelli bowl both nights with spring rolls, sprouts, and lemongrass chicken. The service wasn't the fastest, but for a new place that probably wasn't expecting a huge night-time crowd, they did well. The food showed up within 20 minutes of ordering, and the portions are massive. I probably could have split my bowl in 2 if I wasn't enjoying it so much. The spring rolls were easily my favourite part as well - so much so that I ordered an extra order for my take-out, and tried the deep fried dumplings as well (neither of which disappointed). \n\nCalling for take-out, the order was really easy to place (everything on the menu is numbered, so even if you can't say what you want, you can always just give them a number). I asked about delivery, but with the grand opening, the hostess reminded me that I'd save 15% on my bill if I picked it up myself, so I opted for that route so I could get the extra appetizer...a good decision for sure!\n\nTony's is delicious, authentic, and has friendly service. I'll happily be going back here again, and I'll try to take my friends here as well. Also of note - the menu asks you to alert the server of any allergies you might have, so this might be a good place to check into if you love Vietnamese but can't have nuts!", "date": "2015-02-14 06:43:24"}

I saw nobody wash hands even after blatantly sneezing into hands over an entire half hour visit. Serving food with long hair or long loose beards. Food prep guys in the back (owners?) wearing fuzzy sweaters/hoodies no aprons or gloves. Milk sat out and open on the counter the entire half hour we were there walked past many times by all staff even when no customers. $17 for one coffee a london fog and two admittedly pretty good muffins is tolerable but on the high end for such mediocre service.\nBased on a single half hour visit:\nNobody will talk to you at all. Nobody asks how things are, nobody greets you or says good bye etc. No little things. We wondered about many things such as some kind of special tea they had and food selections but just couldn't get the attention of any of the six people that seemed to be either working or in the ownership group. It's not like we tried hard but we felt ignored. Couple this with the ultra casual look and it all comes off as poor service imo.\n\nThe coffee in our order was handed to me half full \"the pot ran empty, but we will top you up later\". I had to go up myself later and wait in a short line to finally get the promised top up to compliment the bottom of the pot he just gave me *shrug*. My expectation would have been \"sorry sir but we are brewing a fresh pot, have this on the house while you wait and we will get your fresh cup out in a moment\". Just a suggestion.\nWe are in Airdrie a lot.\nMaybe we'll try it again someday, but maybe not.", "date": "2015-12-02 04:42:59"}

This one we were avoiding for some time due to the fact that the prices are significantly higher here than the other restaurants.  We finally decided to give it a try....\n\nWe walked into what looked like a very Greek restaurant, standard pillars and archways you would see common in most traditional Greek establishments.  Confusing, but whatever.  There were 2 other couples in the place, far from busy.  The menu was very lacking when compared to all other similar restaurants.  \n \nI ordered a lemongrass chicken and noodle stir-fry with mixed vegetables.  The wife ordered a beef stew.  \n\nThe beef stew:\nServed in the standard huge bowl with one exception.  The giant bowl had a foot on the table about 1.5 inches across.  Tiny little base, huge bowl?  Put your spoon in and you nearly tip the bowl.  I figured a certain someone will be wearing their soup/stew soon.  As for the taste, I'm not sure how you can call it a beef stew when its made from tasteless chicken broth with a couple small chunks of beef in it, a handful of noodles and almost nothing else.  Disappointing. \n\nThe chicken/noodle/veggie stir-fry:\nI don't know how this is called a stir-fry at all.  This dish was 75% raw peppers and onions, 10% noodles that had just come out of the fires of hell waiting to melt your face off, 2% frozen chicken that was still frozen despite sitting on the noodles, and 13% grease (no, not sauce, grease!).  No sauce, no lemgrass, no spices, no flavour.  The only thing was that cooked was the noodles.  I probably would have been more impressed if they just gave me a plate with whole peppers and onions for me to chop up myself, and a glass of grease for a drink. \nUnbelievable. \n\nWe both are not people that complain, but we were extremely close.  Instead we just smothered everything in the one thing they couldn't screw up, bottled hoisin sauce, and managed to choke half our meals down before giving up.  \n\nWe waited for the bill for a while. and continued to wait. and waited some more.   Just as I stood up to go to the counter to inquire about the bill we finally received our drinks.  \n\nAnd they charge a premium price?!

Another opportunity to possibly further damage my car! \n\nDon't worry, I bought new replacement rockers and I am sharing my experience everywhere and anywhere.  \nEven after your threat of \"cautioning me against telling everyone I know about my experience and to stay away\". Thats smart in desperation,  threaten the customer in hopes you scare them to not Share thier experience. You're a paid advertiser on this site wich part of that process allows customers to leave reviews.  This isn't the school yard where your bullying strategy may have worked as a kid.\n\nYou can tell your side however you want.  I know the truth and it seems I am not the only one that has visited your location with misinformation,  questinoable charged/pricing, or safety issues upon leaving.  Enjoy the fact you saved some money denying what you did to my car. I hope it pays off. Not to mention a foul mouthed shop manager I had to listed too over the phone berate the staff with the mouth of a trucker. ( I feel bad for truckers when I say that!)\n\nAgain my recommendation is to Stay Away from Mr. Lube in Airdrie Walmart location period! Visit Jiffy Lube, Lube Express, even the dealership! But stay away from this location period!  Or anything owned by Prairie Lube Ltd.  I have even had great service with Mr Lube Locations in Calgary.\n\nMy review can also be seen on Google,  Yellow Pages,  even the Facebook page for Corporate Mr.Lube. not to mention social media where I can share with all my car friends and they have shared as well.", "date": "2014-11-20 17:52:01"}

I had heard from a local that this place attracts a rough crowd and overall may not be the most desirable place in town to hang out.  Well, it may not be, but I'm from small town Saskatchewan and this place is completely acceptable as far as I'm concerned.  It looks like it's been renovated and is rather nice.  The restrooms are better than many well used Calgary restaurants.  \n\nI've only eaten buffet style here but I certainly had no complaints.  They actually made some sort of hot dip for nachos once and it was amazing.  The meal they provided for the Stampede event I attended a few weeks ago was great and they had a corn dish I'd never eaten before.  The drinks are inexpensive and the servers are attentive.  \n\nAs for the crowd, it has always had its characters and I'd not make bets on a single woman meeting her husband here.  However, I've had a good time and it's not a pretentious atmosphere.  There isn't much for natural light and they tend to keep the blinds closed.  They do face West (I think) and maybe the sun gets in one's eyes.  I'm not a huge fan of a dark room in the summer months, which really would be my only deterrent.  If you enjoy karaoke, Bambino's has that too, as well as a couple of pool tables.", "date": "2013-07-22 02:57:37"}

I am more of a black or white kinda gal, so I will preface this review with a promise \"to follow up\" in the near future for a more definitive opinion. I also understand this is a fairly new location and they need to work out the kinks. They are pushing it with about a year of being open...\n\nWe have been here a few times before this review so I will give you a consolidated summary of the good and not so good.\n\nOne of our past experiences we had ordered our food and had to wait over an hour for it to come out while some people who came in after us were getting their orders before us. After we kicked up a fuss with our waitress she went in the kitchen and the food then came out luke warm and made wrong. I ordered my sandwich with cheese and after taking a bite found out there was none. So I sent it back for two deficiencies, cold sandwich, made wrong. Now this is what kills me... They put a piece of cold cheese on my already cold sandwich (you know, the one I already took a bite out of) and brought it back to me!!!! That is insane and begging for a negative review! It was obviously a calamity of errors between our waitress and the kitchen. After asking to speak to the Shift Manager because our experience was so horrible she did manage to make it right with her magical manager ways. \n\nOn the same visit they had U.S. College Basketball on almost every tv but what doesn't make sense to me is the World Junior Hockey Championship was only on 2 small tv's that we could barely see from our table. Team Canada was playing, we live in Canada and we were at the Canadian Brew House. What????? \n\nHad I reviewed this location after this visit they would have received a one star rating and only because of their fabulous manager and that is about it. BUT I really want to like this place so I refrained.\n\nThis most recent visit when we were ordering drinks, I was interested in having a glass of wine. I know that they had been carrying Kim Crawford, Savignon Blanc by the glass, but to my dismay the wine list had changed (I had an old, sticky, menu in my hands). Not one decent white wine option and not one Savingnon Blanc available. Disappointed. Our Server suggested the Shiraz then I had to inform her that Shiraz is a red and Savingnon Blanc is white. Guess this is a \"Brew House\" so they may not know, but the staff should be familiar with their own menu. I know there are better options by the bottle, but I don't want a bottle, just a nice glass of wine with lunch. Not boat gas. They will need to change the 'by the glass' options before I come back again. And yes, I only drink wine~ not beer. \n\nTheir 'by the glass' options are not the same as their 'by the bottle' options (which are pretty decent). Who is making these decisions and why do you choose to carry twice the inventory? Makes no sense at all! Obviously they are getting a contractual rebate or a lower cost/ higher margin from the 'by the glass' wine vendors.\n\nI spoke to Drew, who was the shift manager about this when he came around to our table and he was fantastic! They are lucky to have him in their employ (he went around and spoke to everyone! A rarity). He was empathetic and offered a few different options to get around this swill they are now offering. Half price bottle Thursday or ordering a bottle and taking what isn't drank at the time, home. I will never do the latter because I won't pay double for a bottle of wine that I can buy at the liquor store, I am smarter than that and they have yet to win my loyalty as a customer to earn this. Drew did intrigue me with the Thursday option. \n\nTheir Management Team is 'hands down' fantastic!!! And that is the only reason right now that they get three stars.\n\nJust a few more minor notes. 1. The regular order of nachos is huge (like, can't wrap your arms around, kind of huge), perhaps they should offer a half size option. We felt really bad about wasting all the food that we couldn't eat because we were unaware of the size when we ordered. 2. Pickled jalape\u00f1os are waaaayyy better than fresh on nachos, we thought the fresh was just weird and a little uncommon. 3. Remove all wicker (nacho tray for example) from your restaurants. Anyone in the restaurant/ hospitality industry knows wicker can not be cleaned. \n\nI am looking forward to revisiting this location after all cylinders are firing together and updating my review!", "date": "2016-03-15 04:11:52"}

Booking was quick and same day through their easy and user friendly online system. When we got there, the waiting area was spacious and welcoming. A lot of tattoo shops/piercing parlours can have a hard and intimidating atmosphere, but Human Kanvas was clean and modern and seemed more like a trendy retail store than your stereotypical tattoo parlour.\n\nThe girl at the front desk was an absolute gem - my one year old son had a love affair with her, and she was so friendly and super helpful; I'm only sorry I never grabbed her name.\n\nAll of the clients that came in were down to earth and friendly, and interacted with my son and I. Oh! Yes, I brought my one year old son in his stroller and he fit right in. I wouldn't say this place is like, a next level daycare, but it's not like you walk in with your kid and feel like you have to leave them in the car while you get your piercing done. \n\nRyen was an absolute doll and [obviously] a total master of the piercing trade. I've never had a piercing done at a parlour before. I've only ever had lobe and cartilage piercings (8 at one point) done with a gun at my local Merle Norman's and/or Shoppers Drug Mart.\n\nEverything was SUPER clean. Immaculate and tasteful in cleanliness and appearance. Ryen placed the stud in the perfect spot and did such a thorough job of explaining everything and walking me through the entire process.\n\nI'm SO impressed with the service and atmosphere and level of professionalism exemplified by all of the staff and clientele at Human Kanvas. I am eager to come back to have future piercings and/or tattoos done. And may I say, the quality of my Anatometal earring is... next level awesome. I didn't realize there was ever better quality than what was available at Merle Norman, to be honest. Now I want to change up all my hardware to rose gold opalescent bling haha\n\nI'm also really happy with all the information Ryen gave me regarding getting my daughter's lobes pierced. She is so honest and genuine, yet totally bad @$$. I'm really really happy. And so far, my piercing is healing SO well.\n\nMy only gripe is the cost, and that's likely just my own darn fault for getting used to going the cheap route and receiving a mediocre experience. You are paying for quality hardware and equipment, expertise and cleanliness, etc. Don't walk in thinking you're gonna drop $50 total on a piercing. But I can almost guarantee that you'll be so happy with the experience that you'll be able to justify the end result.", "date": "2017-06-23 22:33:47"}

You are first greeted by a pretty cool sports bar decor, with one wall made from old hockey sticks, another made from backlit corona bottles, and about 65 big screen TV screens including four made into a \"Jumbotron\" above the bar. If you want to catch the game, there is no way to find a bad seat in the house for that. \n\nWe sat ourselves in the area up top and immediately noticed that for a Wednesday lunch hour, the place was packed! We were served quite promptly by our server and received our drinks right away. Between three of us we ordered 2 of their daily special of tenderloin, mashed potatoes and Caesar salad for $12.99 which came skewered with a lottery ticket, a pound of wings (we ordered another later) and their bacon wrapped stuffed jalape\u00f1os. The steaks were cooked well to order and the wings were reportedly delicious (my son's meal). The bacon wrapped jalape\u00f1os were absolutely disgusting. Rather than the traditional method of stuffing them, they have opted for a lengthwise halving, plopped the cream cheese on top, then wrapped the wildly varying sizes of peppers with bacon. I am not sure what made those tiny little peppers so wilted and shrivelled, but it sure wasn't too much time in the oven judging from the practically raw bacon draped around them. I took the bacon off mine and ate the pepper, well, a bite of it. Yuck! My partner bit one and that was all. He spat his out and he likes tender bacon. A food abomination like this would not have been so notable aside from the \"Oh, that's too bad\" we received from the server and the $11.99 we paid to have a revolting looking plate sitting in the middle of the table, but we probably would have replaced it with something else and had a better dish to rave about and remember. I am pretty sure our server loaded up on Valium before her shift, so to be fair it may be why she didn't apparently care about too much beyond a monotone repetition every time she was near the table of the phrase \"How's the food..\", it was not so much a question, though.\n\nMy impression of the place takes me back to why my 15-year-old probably wanted to go back even after his Dad and StepMamma won't return. I later learned they disliked the food. His first reason is he loves chicken wings and they did wings pretty well. The second is likely that, for whatever reason, despite the failure of Fox in Airdrie that had similar female uniforms and the closure of Hooters and The Tilted Kilt in Calgary, they seem to feel that their establishment has enough other positive qualities to buck the widely reported trend away from scantily clad, (and in our case, vacuous) servers. They wear skirts that do not fully cover the buttocks of their female servers- no joke, you can see a full quarter cheek of the female servers butt cheeks while they are standing up straight! The male server and the male bartender were dressed quite sharply, but it was a conservatively striking contrast to the scantily clad women and even left a bad taste of objectification in my Fianc\u00e9's mouth (although, again, that could have been the appetizer...). I am all for sexy and revealing, this was just overplayed, predictable and trashy. \n\nI would maybe go back to watch a hockey game, order wings and enjoy a few beers. It would not be my first choice, which is unfortunate as the menu had some tempting offerings and the decor was really inviting and even had a \"Terrence and Phillip\" mural. When the novelty of being new wears off, there is nothing so unique or special to keep this place busy.", "date": "2015-04-09 20:32:51"}

As I was paying for the items the staff was wrapping the items and gave me the bag after I had paid for the transaction.\n\nWhen I arrived home and brought the bag into the house it lightly swung from the weight of the chalkware and bumped into the door frame as I unlocked the door.

I figured I would call the store and ask why it wasn't wrapped in bubble wrap.\n\nWhen I called I asked to speak to the manager. A woman came on the phone and I explained what happened and asked about the bubble wrap. She said they never use it but felt bad and offered a store gift certificate.

You can never go wrong with the food, no matter what you order, it is consistently wonderful.  I usually eat in the restaurant, but I can also say that on the many times we have had home delivery things are also usually perfect.  On two occasions, we were delivered the wrong pizza (we are all human, things happen...), and within 15 minutes we were delivered a hot and fresh replacement, and told to just keep the wrong one.  Point being, they take great pride in making things right on the very few occasions a mistake is made.\n\nMy only issue with eating in was on a recent visit.  The restaurant was packed, and my friend and I sat in the lounge.  The service was ok, but it could have been better.  Servers were very insistent on only servicing their own tables, serving their table next to yours and willfully avoiding eye contact with you as you held out your empty glass, and I was really bothered by the fact that my empty beverage glass not only sat on the edge of the table for more than 15 minutes when we saw BOTH lounge servers put on their coats and go outside to smoke outside the window where we ate.  At that point, there was no staff member covering the lounge.  It would have been cool if we weren't utterly parched for a second drink for so long before they left.  I worked service industry for 13 years, and the friend I was bringing for the first time still works service industry and has for almost 20 years.  You never go out to smoke when there is work to be done, and when your paying patrons are thirsty (We were purchasing cocktails and beer, not pop refills...).  Service 101.\n\nIf it wasn't for the inconsistent service, Paul's would get a solid 5 stars from me.  But even with the service issues I had (and believe me, having worked in the industry as long as I did, I have a far more forgiving view on service...) the food is so good I can't take my rating lower unless the server threw my food on the floor in front of me.  Because it is just that tasty, I would likely still try and eat the salvageable parts of the meal....", "date": "2012-12-10 06:54:14"}

Anyways not a good start and it didn't get better from there. \n\nI got the oasis breakfast which consisted of blueberry pancakes, two eggs, sausage, bacon and potatoes. The blueberry pancakes were completely cold. Not even warm a little bit. They needed more blueberries. Everything else was super average, if that. This place is nothing special. The potatoes were plain.\n\nThen my friend was served crepes instead of the Belgian waffle she ordered so they took it back and brought her the Belgian waffle. When they brought it back they said it was 50% off because it was not perfect as the waffle had become stuck to the waffle iron. So they get her order wrong, and then serve her something that probably shouldn't have been served. Or at any other place it wouldn't have left the kitchen anyways. \n\nOur table had mixed reviews some of my other companions thought the food was cold as well; others said the Cretan, eggs and beans were tasty. It was a mixed bag. Also the chocolate milk came in a super tall glass which was also appreciated.

I had a fuel line come off while I was driving my son home from school and made a mess of gas everywhere. I was stranded, blocking traffic, no cell phone, no one would stop to help (at first) and everyone was getting angry because I was messing up their day.\n\nTwo nice men from the City Public Works stopped to let me use their phone and help me get out of the middle of the road for traffic to flow better.  The Fire Dept had to come to clean up the mess of fuel and I was going to need a tow. Luckily one of the FD crew was mechanically inclined, knew what to look for and reattached the hose. He then recommended I come see the crew at Smart Auto to get them to check and make sure it was all attached properly and nothing was broken.  \n\nI arrived at Smart Auto and spoke with Greg who had Grant take my vehicle into the bay and check things out. Grant went over it with me, I verified which hose had come off and he confirmed it was all good, it was just not put back on properly after another mechanic had completed some work but it was back in place now. Grant then washed all the excess spilled fuel from the engine compartment, dried it all up and topped up my Coolant for added measure. Above and beyond in my mind! And then they sent me on my way with a \"have a great night!\" No charge!!! That's unheard of these days! \n\nAfter an extremely stressful day, this was just the thing I needed to happily get through my evening and renew my faith in humanity. There are some pretty wonderful people in this city and I was lucky enough to meet several of them yesterday including Greg and Grant!! Thank you!!", "date": "2016-11-25 18:15:13"}

A co-worker of ours (Darlene) lives in Airdrie so we stopped to check out her new place and discussed where we should head for dinner.  She mentioned Paul's Pizza and Steakhouse along with other places but we decided to go with what she mentioned first.  It was about 6:30PM when we arrived at Paul's.  We went into the lounge area and my first impression was it reminded me kind of like the show Cheers...where locals meet to drink, relax, chat and have fun.\n\nThere were a couple of booths free, so we snagged one.  The waitress noticed us right away so she approached us and apologized right off the bat because she was the only server and there was a good amount of people to keep her fairly busy.  After waiting a bit, she gave us menus.  I found there was a good selection of lounge food, the typical wings, pizza, burgers, nachos steaks...\n\nI decided to go with the full order Veal Cutlets with french fries, my girlfriend went with the steak sandwich with garden salad and balsamic, her sister went with the Chef's Special Sirloin and Darlene went with the steak sandwich with caesar salad.\n\nThe VC and Chef's Special Sirloin both came with soup or salad to start.  We both got the soup of the day which was mushroom.  When the soup arrived, it was...different.   When I think of mushroom soup, I think of it as white and this wasn't white but a beef broth color.  It was a bit salty but still good.  When the main courses arrived they looked great!  My VC was covered in gravy with a nice portion of fries and a side of vegetables with some nice sauce on them.  The VC was breaded, grilled and tasted pretty good!  The steak sandwiches looked like regular steak sandwiches.  I had a taste and the meat was juicy and tender.  Lastly, the Chef's Special Sirloin was topped with mushrooms and came with spaghetti and boy did that plate look full.  We figured it would be a small side of spaghetti but it covered half the plate! It looked sooo good.\n\nAll in all, we found our meals to be filling and deliicious.  Service was OK but we understand because she was the only server taking care of the whole lounge.  \n\nI like places like this that have that homey feeling with homemade recipes.  I will definitely return to try something else on the menu!!", "date": "2012-05-03 16:56:28"}

I asked my friends for recommendations, being from Calgary, and  Paul's was one of the places highly recommended. I was not really in the mood for pizza again, but my boyfriend told me Paul's was awesome and I decided to give it a shot.\n\nI pulled up what I thought was the menu online. I guess in my extreme hunger I did not notice there is a \" Dinner menu\", as well as a \" Take-out menu\". Too bad :(  I had found a platter that I thought would be so awesome. For only $20, you get \" Battered Button Mushrooms, Beer Battered Shrimp,Paul's Garlic Dry Ribs, Paul's Hummus Delight,Vietnamese Spring Rolls, Zucchini Sticks\". Yum! We were all stoked to get that and a large pizza. There were four adults and two children, and that would have been the perfect amount to feed all of us for only $45 plus tax and delivery/gratuity.\n\nI placed the call and was told by a young- sounding man ,\"Party platter??? I don't have that menu.....but..ok.......\"\n\nSo I ask, \" Ok, could you please make sure it is available, please? It is on the dinner menu, so I don't see why not?\" I am put on hold for maybe 15 seconds.\n\n\" No it is not. I just talked to the \" boss boss\".\n\nNo apology or explanation as why it is not available. I ASSUME, being in the restaurant business myself for around 20 years, that it is either due to it not \" travelling well\" ( such as steaks, certain sauces, ice cream, etc), or not having proper containers to transport it in. You would think that a bunch of appetizers that are all on the take-out  menu separately would be ok ???  A simple\" I am sorry, but the platter is a dine- in special\" would have been nice, but  I was not given any reason, just told they don't deliver that. That's fine, I can find something else, I guess. I told the guy that I would call back in a few minutes after I knew what we wanted.\n\nAfter reading the menu and being super disappointed that I wasn't getting the platter, I finally decided to suck it up and just get a pizza and a side of the Hummus . I called back.\nIt was a girl who answered the phone this time, and she was a little bit rude.\n\n\" I would like to make an order for delivery please.\"\n\n\" Are you sure?\" ( RUDE!!!!!!!  Am I sure?? Are you kidding me? WTH?)\n\n\n\" Yes........???\" \n\n\" Oh well is this **** *********??\"\n\n\" Yes.\"\n\n Sigh, \" K what can I get for you ?\"\n\nI order a large chef's special and a Paul's special Hummus.\n\n\n\" Is that a large as well?\" ( I think she was thinking that was a pizza as well? I had to clarify that I wanted the hummus appetizer.)\n\nShe wasn't super rude, but the \" Are you sure??\" question was pretty darn rude and she definitely wasn't overly friendly.Definitely not the kind of person  I would want answering my phone if I had a restaurant, but maybe she was having a bad day or something?? After having an employee who was either new or improperly trained, and then dealing with a somewhat rude girl, I  did not know what to expect with the rest of the service or the food.\n\nTHANK GOODNESS the delivery came when it was supposed to, the driver was friendly and the food was delicious. I would have given it a 4 to 4.5/5 had I not dealt with the semi-rude girl and the first guy who seemed not to be in the know.\n\nI will probably order from here again, as the food IS delicious , but I hope to deal with someone in a little bit better of a mood next time.", "date": "2017-03-06 18:24:44"}

The pizza always has generous toppings and shows up hot! Note: the pizza here is not skimpy, a medium can feed my Hubs and I with leftovers. \n\nNow, they have made one small change. Our pizza used to show up a bit soggy on the bottom. This was to be expected with the sheer amount of volume, but now they have some sort of plastic disc laid under the pizza that prevents that. Wow! Our last pizza showed up with a crispy bottom crust!! \n\nWe have been dying to try other items from Paul's so we decided to go into eat on Friday night. We were a party of 3 and showed up at 5:30 and the place was packed! Wow, what a shock! We thought we were going early enough to avoid a wait. There were no tables in the restaurant and we got the last table in the lounge. Lucky us! \n\nThe food was great! We started with their featured shrimp appie and were not disappointed. My lasagna was fabulous and my MIL's steak was still cooked to her desired 'medium' although the steak was thin.

While I'd come back, I'm more interested in the low early-morning prices and carafe of coffee on the table than in the quality of the food or the mostly uninspired menu items. While the Airdrie Cora has terrible service most of the time, this place lacks the quality and branding that would make the experience enjoyable and more memorable.\n\n\n\nWe were a little bit skeptical about coming here, given some of the poorer reviews EggsOasis has gotten already, but due to consistently sub-par service at Cora, we chose to check this place out. I'm even more skeptical about trying breakfast places on Sunday mornings due to the high chance of things being really busy and getting poor service. \n\nWhen we pulled up, we noticed several open seats on the patio, so we were hopeful that there wouldn't be much of a wait to be seated. When we walked in, we were seated instantly inside, and the waitress was at our table within seconds to take our drink order. We grabbed coffees and waters, and they were there, along with a carafe of coffee, within a minute or two - super fast. We both ordered breakfast food - I grabbed a \"Double Bite\" which included a banana-creme crepe, eggs, meat, and potatoes, and my date grabbed an eggs benedict which came with potatoes and fruit. \n\nI don't think it was 10 minutes and our meals arrived at our table. Our waitress left a bit to be desired - she wasn't the friendliest person on the planet, but we also didn't really need anything either - there was enough coffee in the carafe, and all of the condiments were already on the table. We ate in peace, and the bill came after our plates looked finished, and we were brought the debit machine to pay up. All in all, I think from the time we were seated to the time we left, we were there for 30 minutes or less. \n\nThe food was good, but not spectacular. The crepes were more like thin pancakes than authentic french crepes - a bit too thick and doughy? The sausage was good, but generic, and the bacon was tasty but thin. Potatoes were cooked well, but a bit bland. Essentially, I could have made this at home, but for not wanting to cook. The menu boasted some very low-price breakfasts from 6-9 AM, and lunch specials that included soup and coffee in the price.\n\nAs a note on the ambience: I feel like EggsOasis is having an identity crisis. Their branding suggests a desert oasis, morning refuge sort of environment. What the interior and the menu suggested were very different. There is a very open concept to the restaurant - essentially four walls, divided by a pony-wall pathway from the entrance to the hostess stand. The beige-coloured restaurant was very loud, even though there were a decent number of empty seats available. The walls were decorated with canvas paintings of food items, as well as Rocky Mountain-inspired oil paintings in ornate wood frames. There were the odd palm frond around the restaurant for greenery as well. Even the menu was sort of all over the place, where you could order \"Double bites\" (which really had no reason for the name - the plates were neither double-sized, nor offered much different than the standard egg breakfasts), and things such as  baked beans and creton spread which were considered \"classics\". Basically I feel like the restaurant can't decide if it's going to be themed like a generic restaurant from the 80s, a Cora knock-off, or a Denny's (I feel like the Double Bite may just be their version of a Grand Slam?).", "date": "2015-06-28 19:03:54"}

(Will not order that sissy drink again) Pizza was yummy and was temperature very hot had to let cool. \n\nLike any restaurant it can be a hit or miss depends on how busy the place is.  \n\nParking is normally not an issue, could be more on Friday or Sunday lunch.", "date": "2017-10-21 02:47:13"}

D ordered the Brie Cheese and Ham benny with the Royal Blend fruit juice, and I ordered the Oasis Ambrosia, also with the Royal Blend fruit juice.\n\nNow most breakfasts are cooked relatively quickly, especially in a restaurant that specializes in that style.  An agonizingly long 35 minutes later we had our food and yet no drinks.  I asked the server who brought us our food where our drinks were.  Now, 10-15 minutes prior to being served our food our drinks were put up at the pass but they were not brought to our table until I asked where they were.  That is an unnecessarily long wait for drinks and to find out it was the pair that were sitting directly within my line of sight was upsetting to say the least.\n\nFor the food:\n-The oasis ambrosia was decent, lots of cream and fresh fruit, however the french toast was flavourless and almost uncooked.\n\n-The royal blend was so thick it was difficult to drink, not typical of fresh fruit juice, and mostly consisted of seeds (we found out why afterwards).\n\n-The benny had no brie, or if it did it was so well hidden D couldn't find it, and the whole plate came cold.  The potatoes that came with it were under cooked, not seasoned, and had a taste similar to styrofoam (which I tried as well so the description is definitely accurate).  His fruit was not very fresh, the eggs were cooked okay, and the hollandaise was bland and cold.\n\nWhen we got the bill it had an upcharge on our juices for 'smoothie.'  We never ever ordered them as smoothies, preferring freshly squeezed juices for breakfast, which turned out to be why they were almost undrinkably thick.\n\nThe biggest joke here was that it was passed off by management as 'trainee server,' however even a newbie server cannot also be responsible for the terrible food that came from the kitchen or the lack of drinks when other people MUST have noticed the two glasses sitting at the pass for so long.\n\nAll in all it was a terrible experience and we definitely will not be returning, nor will we be interested at any time in trying any other branch of the franchise.", "date": "2015-07-12 02:37:56"}

Well, what can I say about that.  If you use this auto repair facility \"Smart\" you may not be.\n\nTook my truck to be diagnosed and to have what I believed to be a transmission problem appraised/looked at.  I had been using Smart Automotive for years, spend thousands on multiple vehicle repairs and always trusted their integrity.  Not to mention sent them a whole bunch of new customers.\n\nThen Smart Automotive was sold by the original owner to one of the employees.  Wow, did things change.  \n\nMy truck is an older Ford F150, 2004 to be exact.  I had recently changed insurance companies and my new insurance company wanted a safety inspection on the truck as it was more than 10 years old.  No problem, right?  The truck was/is in A1 condition with less than 140,000 K on it.  \n\nThe transmission was estimated to cost me with replacement of a reconditioned transmission at just under $3000.00.  I said fine but make sure you go over the truck and repair what is required for it to be able to obtain a safety certificate.  \n\nOk.  So far so good right?  Then I get a phone call saying that the truck had all kinds of other problems, leaking wheel cylinders, needed a tune up, replace this that and the other.  The new cost was now $6300.00.\n\nTo say I was not a little surprised would be a huge understatement.  However like I said, had been using Smart Automotive for years and was always satisfied with their integrity and work (before it was sold to an employee).  I gave the go ahead to have the work completed but was a bit reluctant as the truck was a 2004 and it really was $6300.00 I could have put towards a new truck.\n\nThree days later I arrived to pick up my truck.  But....I did not have a safety certificate when I was presented and paid for the invoice.  I asked if I could please have a copy of the safety certificate for my insurance company because obviously it was just an over site on Smart Automotive's part....right?\n\nI was told, no word of a lie.  Oh....ya...I forgot that you wanted a safety inspection?  I said pardon.  Then I was told just hold on a second while I talk to my mechanic that worked on your truck.\n\nAfter waiting for 10 minutes I was then told, well....if you want a safety inspection it is going to cost you another $1800.00!!!!!\n\nWell after $6300.00 which was bad enough and then being told they apparently did not do the work the truck was there for in the 1st place within that $6300.00 and it would cost my another $1800.00 bringing the total to $8100.00 I was a little less than impressed.   $8100.00 I could of put towards a new vehicle but was now being held ransom for another $1800.00 as of course I already put in $6300.00 so you know.....whats another $1800.00.\n\nI said a few choice words took my truck and left.  Two weeks later I had the truck safety certified by an Airdrie competitor of Smart Automotive for a grand total.......wait for it......$70.00.   They couldn't find anything wrong with the truck, albeit I did spend $6300.00 on it at Smart Automotive but saved myself a further $1730.00 by going elsewhere and not getting further ripped off..\n\nSmart Automotive, I believe used to be a very good facility....before it was sold to one of its employees.  Now it appears to be a money hungry, take  customer for all you can for anything you can all to familiar auto repair facility.\n\nMy advice.  Go somewhere else.

I believe this to be true of most people.  Anyways...\n\nI have been coming to this spa since we moved to Airdrie in 2016. My main service is the pedicure which I do 6 months out of the year (great  thing about living in Winter Wonderland is that no one sees my toes for the other 6 months and this saves me money lol, sorry, I digress).  I also started shellac manicures last year and have been generally satisfied. I normally request Helen or Jesse.  I would rate their skills as good - not stellar, or mind-blowing but good, solid and fairly consistent. \n\nTheir prices are one of the main reasons I have consistently gone back - other than the fact that I am a creature of habit.  Their prices are very competitive and I do appreciate this.  \n\nAs far as friendliness goes, no one has been rude but no one is outstandingly warm or inviting either.\n\nI have brought my family/friends here for services over the last couple of years, but I will not be going back.  The reason?  Last week I treated my baby brother to his first pedicure.  He is a fitness buff who can run like no one's business and so his feet take a beating.  The total service time was 15 minutes. That's right, a pedicure in 15 minutes.  It was the shortest spa pedicure I've witnessed in 20 years.  There were no others waiting, so there was no need to rush, and I had called in the appointment, so I was not a walk-in.  Now I understand that my brother is not getting his toe nails painted, but then for heaven's sake, give him more massage time, or take extra care with his callouses, etc.  \n\nThe thing that really irked me is that the pedicure was done by the owner of the nail spa - someone who should go the extra mile for her clients - someone who knows I come in regularly - someone who knew this was my brother's first experience - but someone who rushed through the service and didn't care.  If it was any other technician, I probably wouldn't be writing this review right now, but the owner of any business who is stingy/frugal will NOT be getting my business again. \n\nI manage a family-owned business and I work hard for my clients. I expect a similar level of service when I am the client.  I believe in supporting businesses who have the same philosophy as I do:\nBe Grateful For Your Clients.

After paying what I'd consider a reasonable price ($8.93 taxes in), I then had to pull around the back of the building and wait by the door for someone to carry out my pizza.  They have a security camera monitoring the area and it felt weird to wait there in amongst work trucks and equipment.  It was about 7 minutes, which I still thought was pretty good for fast food pizza, but I'd rather wait in a nice warm building than sit in my car and get cold during the winter months.  I'm not going to run my vehicle.  Also, I wouldn't want to be the person running in and out with pizza boxes during bad weather either.  They should have put in another window somehow.  \n\nI dug into my pizza immediately because I was nearly late for a meeting and needed to eat.  Don't make the same mistake!  The pizza was so hot (not that I'm complaining) that I totally fried the roof of my mouth.  I've never had pizza that piping hot in my life!  Just follow my advice and wait a few minutes or you'll have a bloody mess in your mouth like I do this morning.  The pizza crust is thin and it wasn't overwhelmingly salty, which I was happy about.  However, the chicken pieces were pretty small and I wasn't sure I could taste BBQ sauce.  It was just okay.  I'd give Little Caesars another chance though, as I've never had their pizza before.  \n\nAll in all, I think the pizza is average and I'd skip the drive-thru.\n\n17/30 for Yelp's 30 Day Challenge", "date": "2011-11-17 14:49:59"}

We thought we'd give this place a try and it's a touch old fashioned but they kept their food tasty.\n\nWe started out sharing a zucchini sticks plate.  The zucchini itself was fresh, not too juicy so they didn't drip everywhere like you get with White Spot back in BC, and the batter was crisp and well seasoned.  The tzatziki dip was really good on its own, high quality thick dip with lots of cucumber bits, but it was not the right dip for zucchini.  A fresh ranch would have been a better complimentary flavour for the zucchini and batter seasoning.\n\nFor the main course we each had an 8oz New York with a soup to start for him and salad for me.  He had the Potato Bacon soup which was supposedly absolutely delicious, and my salad was a simple lettuce and tomato salad with thousand island dressing.  The dressing came in a little take-out cup which was strange and i felt bad using something that would just go in the garbage rather than being washable, but the dressing itself was great.\n\nThe steaks were cooked just right, medium rare so the thin cuts were still nicely pink in the middle.  The flavour was great with light seasoning and a rich buttery coating that was delicious.  The vegetables were perfectly steamed carrots and broccoli coated in hollandaise.  That was a pleasant surprise as we both love all three of those especially when put together.  For the final side I had the stuffed potato and he had the rice.  The rice was simple, with a few vegetables thrown in, and looked pretty good but I think I had the better side with the potato.  The stuffed potato was delicious with cheese, herbs and bacon bits in it.  The splatter of dried parsley around the outside of the plates is a bit dated and should probably be ditched as it's more messy than attractive now.  A clean edged plate would be nicer, and it doesn't add anything to the meal.\n\nAll in all the food was tasty and we while we're staying in Airdrie we will probably go back.", "date": "2015-04-13 17:25:12"}

Club sandwich was cold and soggy. The sauce that came with the pickles was weird, honey mustard mixed with something. They should've asked because their tzatziki probably would've been great. My French onion soup was in such a tiny container that there was almost no broth. It was a huge clump of cheese with soggy bread and gigantic onion slices that I doubt anyone would eat. I'm an onion lover and it grossed me out. \n\nThey are clearly too busy & overwhelmed on the weekends to produce anything worth eating. Most of our $45 order went in the trash. So disappointing.

Welcome to The Chopped Leaf.\n\nThe Chopped Leaf has been around for a little over a year now, and it's one of the places I enjoy in town because of it's quality - even though it's a place to grab a fast lunch, the quality control here is huge. Each time I come back, the food is always fresh and presented in a very appetizing manner. \n\nIf you're new to this place, it's a bit confusing: the menu consists of soups, salads, sandwiches,  whole bowls, and wraps. The salads and wraps can be ordered from the pre-set menu, or you can build your own, with each addition increasing the cost (think of it like a pizza place where you get a few base ingredients and everything else is extra). All of the options are vegetarian to start, and you add a few bucks for protein choices as well. Once you order, you pay and get a number, and take a seat...at rush, expect to wait up to 10 minutes for your food to be prepared, even if you're just getting something that you might think is simple. \n\nAs mentioned, the food comes out looking great all the time - the only time I've ever not had something \"pretty\" was when I ordered a salad to-go, and they accidentally put it in a bowl before transferring it to a take-out container... it was still excellent, just a bit jumbled. \n\nIf I had to pick out a few flaws, it would be the cost and the wait times. Yes, the quality is really good, but I'm not sure  if it justifies the cost entirely. A full-sized salad, with protein and a drink will probably land you around $15, which is a bit steep for something I'd consider to be fast food. The pricing is a bit deceptive too, since I personally prefer some meat in my meals, and it's a minimum of a $2 charge to add any of that to any option on the menu. The wait time is the other problem - I want to call  this a fast-food place since there's no servers to take your order, but the waiting times can be a bit prohibitive if you have less than an hour for lunch. As the line can stretch pretty long at peak hours, you shouldn't plan on it being quick. There is the option to order ahead, but I'd rather drop by and see if I can get in and out quick. \n\nThe short of things? Great food,  fantastic flavours, a bit pricey and a bit slow. The perfect stop for someone trying to eat a bit cleaner, but maybe try the Subway (in the same parking lot) if you're looking for a fast or cheap bite in the area.", "date": "2015-09-11 03:59:35"}

The ingredients and the dough were great quality, although I preferred the chicken tandoori pieces on the butter chicken pieces.  However, what made the pizzas really stand out was the chicken korma sauce we poured on the pizza. We ordered the chicken korma separately, and opted for the spicy option, which we were told meant that there were spices in the sauce such as coriander, cumin, etc...- not that the sauce is hot - and it was delicious on the perfectly cooked fresh nan and on the pizza.

But one lady taking the orders that had some semblance of a clue as to what was going was constantly running outside to check on one child then in the back to check on the other. Hey I have three kids myself I get it, but you don't have child care I don t think your fledging business is the place. \nSo sad really hope they figure it out. But not holding my breath.", "date": "2018-05-11 02:09:44"}

We had an interesting meal; it definitely had its moments, but it also suffered from some significant flaws that were repeated across multiple dishes.\n\nWe ordered the \"Family Style Chef's Surprise Menu\", which was pretty much as described: the chef made whatever struck his fancy and we ate it. :-)\n\nThe dishes were:\n\n* Corn chowder topped with bacon\n* Beet salad with roasted garlic, gravlax, arugula, and sauerkraut\n* Angel hair pasta with chorizo and squid\n* Steamed Lingcod in a red wine sauce served on a bed of white beans\n* Parsnip cake with goat cheese, Asian pear, and meringue  \n\nDescribing each dish in detail:\n\nThe corn chowder wasn't particularly notable other than that it had so many bits in it that it ate more like corn and stuff topped with chowder rather than a corn chowder. It could definitely have used more salt or seasoning. 2.5/5.\n\nThe beet salad contained several different kinds of beets, and the chef painstakingly described the origins of each. They were lightly dressed and very tasty. The flavour in combination with the house-made sauerkraut really didn't work for my wife, although I didn't mind it, but we both agreed that the strongly flavoured gravlax didn't pair well with anything else in the salad. Overall the dish was a weird mishmash of discordant flavours, served in very large pieces. If we'd just been served the dressed beets and perhaps the garlic we would have loved the dish, but with the other components it was a mixed bag. Somewhere between 1.5/5 and 4/5 depending on what ingredients you got in that particular bite.\n\nNot too much to say about the angel hair pasta dish other than that it was delicious. 4.5/5.\n\nThe cod was also tasty, and both of us were surprised that it had a vaguely Asian flavour profile. 3.5/5.\n\nThe cake was overdone and dry. The goat cheese was nice, but totally overpowered the thin slices of Asian pear. The dish was also interspersed with big chunks of meringue, which didn't work at all. Meringue crumbles would have added a hint of crunch to the dish, but since the pieces were so big we ended up eating the other ingredients, then occasionally pausing for an inexplicable mouthful of meringue. The dish would have been better without the meringue, although its real flaw was the overdone cake. 2.5/5.\n\nOverall it was a meal of highs and lows -- the best parts of it were fantastic, but then the next bite often included a jarring flavour that didn't pair well at all with the previous one. Too often there were big chunks of too many ingredients that clashed instead of complimented each other, which made it hard to eat the ingredients together as a unified dish rather than taking alternating bites of each ingredient on the plate.\n\nIt was an interesting meal, the wait staff was very friendly, and the chef brought every dish to our table to describe it. We'd go back, but if our experience was typical, the Globe review and the other reviews here were extremely generous.", "date": "2016-10-21 06:20:57"}

I prefer to order online because the cellular reception in our area is pretty bad so this helps reduce error.\nAlmost immediately after I placed my order I received a call from who I assume was the manager. He told me they don't have Boylan soda. No big deal I had seen that they had San Pelligrino also so I asked for one of those instead. He asked me to repeat myself and then said no they don't have that. Only coke products. So I settled for iced tea. Again not the worst, but still fairly annoying.\nMy husband went to pick up the order and that was a complete mess. The person who was there had to have it explained to her that Skip the Dishes offers pick up service and she gave my husband a hard time, then he gave her my information and they still made him contact me and give them the order number. I'm pretty sure some random dude isn't  coincidentally showing up on time for my order to steal my pizza. And I understand they have to do their job, but again we were met with attitude from the get go. \nI will give them a little more time to get settled in, and try them again. Hopefully they can make it because their pizza is great, but they really need to work on the customer service side and maybe they shouldn't have jumped into using skip the dishes without properly reviewing their menu and training their staff.

One thing I did notice was the amount of staff they had working for such a small place.  I think I counted 6 on the floor and 4 or 5 in the kitchen!  I later found out one of the gentleman on the floor was indeed the restaurants owner.  It was nice to see him out on the floor and talking to the guests and busing tables.  \nOur server was ok, she seemed to be a tad bit frazzled though I'm not sure why. \nI ordered the white bean dip with flatbread as an appetizer to share.

As for flavor, it was lacking a bit of seasoning and maybe some herbs/garlic. \nFor mains I ordered the Gnocchi as I wanted to try their homemade pasta, as a rule I never order pasta at a restaurant unless I know it's homemade. ( I can cook pasta at home) My husband ordered the Ling Cod and chips.\n\nThe Gnocchi was very tasty and they were a nice size and had just the perfect crisp to them.  They came paired with Morel and chanterelle mushrooms, with Kale, pork lardons and a pesto type sauce.  All of the flavors together were fantastic.  I had the full order and I was full.  \nMy husband's Ling Cod was very light and flaky and had a wonderful mouth feel.  It was served with huge homemade taters wedges which where pan fried.  They paired wonderful with the homemade tomato relish (in place of ketchup) and the tartar sauce.  I would most defiantly recommend the Ling Cod and chips if you have a chance to stop in here for dinner. \n \nUnfortunately neither of us had any room left to sample dessert so we may need to go back.\nUpon our departure we found a magazine article which outlined the owners bio and we learned of the decor features of the restaurant which has a large wooden door from a local home and the bar is made from barn doors.  Very unique.", "date": "2017-02-28 01:42:49"}

First, I have to say I am a stickler for grammar and punctuation so I was immediately turned off by the 11 obvious errors throughout the flyer. If you are going to publish something and mail it to 50,000 people, make sure it's edited! (And hopefully you don't have this same brochure published in the other markets you are in.) Ok, so that is just getting picky!\n\nMore importantly, let's discuss the food and service... We had a great experience ordering over the phone (no web site to order from), the guy was nice and we had no problem. They said 30-45 min for delivery so when it showed up 70 min later we were a little disappointed, crossing our fingers that our pizza hadn't sat in the back of a car forever. We don't mind waiting, if it's going to be over an hour, tell us it will be over an hour- then at least we won't already be mad when it arrives. Set the customers expectations to start and you should be ok.\n\nThe pizza... NOT \"A Perfect Pizza\". Unfortunately when we opened the box, the pizza was slightly crushed (these things happen), but the pizza looked~ sad. The vegetables had a slight brown tinge to them, the pizza was flat and the cheese looked cheap. Once we dug in, with some hesitation, we found the crust was doughy and slightly raw in the center. \n\nI don't know if there has ever been a pizza that my hubs and I have ever walked away from until this day. We got a \"special\" that included 4 cans of soda, too bad it was the most expensive pop we have ever bought because the pizza was inedible. \n\nThe best thing about this place is that they say they donate 2% of sales to the Humane Society which is why I give them a star at all.", "date": "2014-07-23 15:59:36"}

Are you single?\nAlas, I am not but I felt like I was cheating a bit as your cooking won me over and tugged at my heartstrings!\n\nThis place was recommended to us by a couple of people. My husband is Spanish and we love tapas style dining. I have gotten wayyy better at sharing my food as this new genre of food has made its way into so many communities!\n\nWed night - we did not have a reservation (recommended to have one esp. on weekends) but the 4 of us were seated upstairs in this house converted into a restaurant. (there is parking to the rear)  It was said that the house is the 2nd oldest in Airdrie! The decor was simple with Latin influence and I liked the paint colors up and down in the different rooms. On the upper level there are 2 separate spaces that would accommodate private parties of 6-8 people nicely. The Spanish music really made the atmosphere, it was wonderful.\n\nNow for the good part - the FOOD! WOW! We each chose a tapas plate and vowed we would all share fairly. The plates are staggered so that you get the plates at different times. The chef is made aware of how fast or slow a particular table is to gauge food delivery!\n\nWe ordered a bottle of Chilean red wine (they were out of 'Fat Bastard' our company's first choice), white wine and Estrella beer from Barcelona. All good!\n\nSoup of the day was a potato and corm chowder, really good.\nBaby roasted Potatoes with a lovely dipping sauce.\nChorizo and Sirloin skewers - needed 2 orders for 4 people. Worth it! Steak was cooked med.rare, chorizo very good quality.\nPortobello mushroom, stuffed. Served nice and hot, beautifully done.\nStuffed jumbo shrimp (my choice!) OMG, stuffed with jalapeno and goat cheese. MMM\nPulled pork on crostinis. Melt in your mouth excellent!\nDessert Trio which are said to come from a local bakery. The white cheesecake was my fave!\nEverything was well seasoned!\n\nThe sauces that are served with the dishes are mind blowing. \nTIP Make sure you try the green peppercorn one if you can! They need to bottle that stuff up for sale!\n\nI wanted to order the mussels and was told it was the one thing they did not have tonight. \nTIP for you mussel lovers - they come in on Thursdays so they are nice and fresh for the busy weekends.\n\nAlex was a great waiter and raved about all items on the menu - kudos to him for going up and down those stairs all night delivering the food and drink.\n\nWe had the pleasure of meeting the Red Seal chef/owner Rico himself just before dessert. He is a wonderfully humble guy, French trained and has used his techniques to make his South American food sing. Rico is from Chile and it is obvious that he is proud of this fact and the food he puts out. He works long days getting up early to go and hand pick his veggies and meats for the day.\nI could absolutely connect with this food on so many levels. I loved the space and the ambiance and we had a wonderful time with our friends. \nI want to go back ASAP to try the mussels, crab cakes and chicken and bacon skewers.\n\nA real gem of a restaurant in Airdrie and I could not think of a reason why this restaurant should get any less than 5 stars. We were impressed!", "date": "2013-01-17 09:21:43"}

Costa Vida is very close what a Caf\u00e9 Rio is like, for those of you that get down to Arizona/Utah/SoCal. Last night I had two sweet pork tacos that were made with freshly made corn tortillas and very good ingredients for about $9.00, but the thing that makes me rave about on about this place is that my favorite drink, horchada,  was priced at $2.29 for I all I could drink. I am thinking I can only find this at some very special places that I have ferreted out in SoCal at this price, and it was mighty tasty as well here. Costa Vida's salsas were very fresh, but if you are into habanero burn your mouth out salsas, you are in for a bit of disappointment, as the spiciest salsa has just a nice smoky mild flavor to me, the other is the standard fresh tomato based salsa that we are all used to. My pinto beans also  had a very good flavor. In my final rating must think about how the ingredients like beans/cheese cost twice as much here in Canada, as in the States, not to mention the labor costs, and I must say that Costa Vida does a very good job at offering some nicely made Mexican food!

They were backed up by about 6 parties and no one was tee'ing off on time. I think this could have been because there was not a Starter present. Then some big mouthed guy about 3 parties behind us decides he was going to take over and start running the show and tell everyone what they are going to do. Ya, no. Go sit down.\n\nSince everyone was backed up we felt very rushed. The ladies in front of us were slower than us so we were waiting at every hole for them to clear while the jerks behind us were hitting and landing their balls about 10 feet away from where we were on the fairway! We told them to back off at every hole, for 9 holes. Apparently our safety was of no concern to them or the course. \n\nWhere was the Marshal????

I'm hoping that by sharing my experience with the company, they could improve and in the mean time, that other customers can make an enlighted decision when they pick which company will move their stuff.\n\nThis was my seventh long-distance moving (inter-provinces) over the last 15 years and I have never experiences such an unprofessional company in all aspect.\nThis company was cheaper, therefore more affordable, but the service was also significantly decrease. I was talked to in a very condescendent manner. I felt ''hostage'' in this situation as they had my belongnings.\n\nFirst of all, despite the fact that they can't promise a specific date (very understandable), they need to provide you with a range of dates. Part of it is on me, as I should have that all written down, but when I booked my move, I didn't care when the boxes were picked up (may/June), I needed them for  end-of-june beginning of July at the new place. When I received a pick-up date of mid-June, I got worried as the contract said 7 to 21 business days. I called the company and was told it should not be a problem, at worse a few days later.  The company honoured the contract, and my stuff was delivered to me by the last possible day (business day 21).  However, this endend up being 1 month later and when I called to inquire during the wait, I was not treated nor responded in a professional manner. To get to me by the last possible day, they had to switch my boxes to a different company, which ended up being the one delivering to me. So the stuff was transfered around and as you deal with different companies, new rules applied.\n\nIn regards of credit card payment, they do had a 3% fees if you want to pay with your credit card, which is not negligible when you consider very long distance moving (thousands of dollars). Those cost are not assume by this company.  The issue, is not really the cost itself, but the fact that no where it mentionned that on the estimate cost contract, or it was mentionned to me until the loading day (when it would be to late to change your mind, or turn around and chose a different comapny). When I mentionend that the rules change as you go... At the end of the day, the last comapny that deliver the stuff at the house don't use credit card at all, so when you expect paying this via credit card as planned, it becomes an issue.\n\nFurthermore, my boxes came to me wet, broken and some opened. If I could I would share picutres with you as I documented this. Some stuff will get damage during a trip, this is part of the journey, but I have never seen this. Things that I wrapped in thick blanket to protect, were unwrapped and the blanket no where to be found...\n\nLast of all... the quote ended up being more, charging extra fees that I do not judge resonable for about 300$ and that were not charge 10 months prior on the move at the exact same place... and, as mentionned, I moved 10 months before, and this time I actually had less tuff as I shipped my car with my tires and didn't have any of my friend stuff that I had move the last time... and the weight ended up being MORE.... make no sense. So there was extra charges there.\n\nDifferent misunderstandings and stuff can happen, but the real reason I would warn the future costumer, it is really the lack of professionalism. The way they talk to you very condescendent, no understanding and despite the fact that they think they are accomodating, they are not. It has been an awful experience", "date": "2017-07-20 12:52:36"}

The Pizza was good, thicker crust and heavier than what I personally enjoy in a pizza, but in all honesty I enjoyed the Indian food the best. Not to say the pizza was bad, it was good, I just like a thinner more crunchy crust. My only  criticism would be the hot saucy food in plastic containers, however I am guessing you are limited with options for hot saucy delivery food containers. Maybe even tin or paper boxes would be better options, but likely less cost efficient. Hot plastic can leech chemicals, that is not to say yours do, but I just prefer to avoid that all together.

Extremely friendly! \n\nI ordered two Lebanese meat pies and one large Donair. It took a bit of time to make everything but I wasn't in a rush and Joe keeps you busy by chatting.\n\nThe pies were excellent, I'm sure they would have been even better if I had eaten them right away but I brought them home to my father. Normally we drive to South Calgary for our meat pie fix, but I don't think we will have to do so any longer! Joe makes sure that everything is kept hot while he makes your order, since he's the only one working. (At least during my visit).\n\nJoe doesn't skimp on anything when it comes to donairs. The large one that I had gotten was quite literally the size of my forearm! Lots of meat and veggies and sauce. My dad said it was really good too.\n\nThe food here is 5/5, but with the atmosphere is 4/5 since the shelves were pretty much bare and there wasn't any kind of decor.\n\nIf you need a yummy lebanese fix, I'd suggest going here.

I couldn't resist the 'Braised Angus Short  ribs in Guinness Stout' and I did not regret my choice!  Succulent, tender, flavorful and accented with silky mashed potatoes and fresh baby vegetables, this was a dish that I will not soon forget!  Amazingly, I was offered a 'complementary' dessert at meal's end.  How good can it be, I thought?

No BS & honest. One of the very few salespeople that I've trusted. I used to be a salesperson myself so I know how rare that is. Very friendly & helpful & was somehow able to remember our names even after only meeting for a few minutes.\n\nMatt, the sales manager, is unpleasant to say the least. Like most sales managers, he is the bad cop in the whole good cop/bad cop scenario. We brought in our old unit for trade. I sent John & Josh in finance an email stating what was happening so everyone was aware. The basic plan was to bring the old trailer from storage & we would empty it into the new trailer & clean it. Well Matt went through the old trailer & for some reason Josh went out too. Then Ken, the owner went to have a look. Josh came back in & with a surprised & angry look on his face said, \"You didn't clean it out!\" I said no, I emailed you & told you what I was doing. After the 3 of them had a long talk about it, Matt asked me to his office. He started telling me about a few of the issues he found; he said it needed excessive cleaning. After listening to him nitpick my trailer, I was getting pretty frustrated & when he claimed it needed excessive cleaning, I almost walked out. The trailer was cleaned before being put into storage last year. The only real cleaning needed was getting my stuff out. Then he asked if he could keep the atv ramps I had in the back to help make up for the cleaning. I said no. Then he asked if he could keep the tv's. I said only if you provide one in my new trailer (they didn't). I took pictures of my trailer once I cleaned it out & funny enough, it looks same as the pics they have posted on line. Matt is not someone I ever want to talk to or deal with again.\n\nNext we went to talk to Josh in finance to sign papers. We initially met at the RV show when we signed the initial docs & I've talked to Josh on the phone & emailed docs back & forth. He was friendly & helpful in our dealings up until this point. I was still a little on edge after talking to Matt so I can honestly say I was not in the greatest mood & a little 'sensitive' to everything. We got into a discussion about the cleaning & Josh started a short lecture on how much time it was going to take & how they need to recover the cost. Again, I got defensive & argumentative, I won't lie. I was frustrated with virtually everyone there by now. I just wanted out!\n\nWe had another date to do our walk through of the new trailer. When we got there, we were greeted by Jason in parts. He also does the walk through. He asked if I brought batteries. Batteries? Nobody told me I needed to bring batteries. This seems like something that should be mentioned at some point before you go to pick up your unit. This is my third new trailer & the first that didn't incl at least one battery. I was frustrated again! Fortunately I had my batteries from the old trailer & they had already been switched over, so crisis averted. Jason was friendly & helpful. We completed the walk thorough & they moved our new trailer & old trailer next to each other so we could move stuff around. We noticed there still wasn't a tv in the new trailer so we asked about it. Myles in service was helping us out. He was very friendly & helpful as well. He asked Matt about the tv & what he told Myles was similar, but not the same as what he told us. Unfortunately I knew from day 1 I wasn't getting a new tv because everyone just kept saying \"oh, I'm sure it will be taken care of\". Always get it in writing folks!\n\nWe had another date to pick up the trailer because I needed to replace the hitch on my truck. When we went in, the service staff were very friendly & helpful. They attempted to install the new hitch, but the brackets were too big & it wouldn't fit. Ken, the owner was also there helping. He suggested a few different options to us. We tried a few different things but nothing worked. We had to wait to go to the shop we bought the hitch at to exchange. I had to go back to Racetrack later in the week to have them install the new hitch so I could try to bring my trailer home this time. The service department closes at 5 but Ken & several of his service staff stayed to help me out. They did charge me for the hitch install which was supposed to be included but they did try to install 2 & they stayed late for me so I'm not complaining about that. Unfortunately one bad sales manager & a couple bad interactions clouded what should have been an exciting time. Fortunately Ken & his parts/service staff helped make up for it & in the end, I left a happy customer.", "date": "2016-04-22 15:45:28"}

I don't want to make this long so i will try to get to the point.\n\nOur car is now over 9 years old. I know...most people get new cars after 5 years and most of the time sooner. We tend to not care too much about wasting money on new cars and tend to try and utilize our car for as long as possible. \n\nNow being over 9 years old you can only imagine what kind of things will need replaced especially that we really have only put about $3000 into the car since we purchased it brand new. Our car was puttering and sounded like it was either having clutch problems or one of the cylinders was not firing. \n\nWe took the car to Canadian Tire and told them what the problem was. a young guy called me twice about 1 hour apart after taking the car for a test drive. both times he called he asked what i thought was wrong with the car as he could not figure it out. It felt as though this guy never worked on a car before or he was so busy he didn't have the time to really test drive it. I told them to take it for a drive because it was extremely easy to see how badly it is driving. Canadian tire did a full inspection (well at least that is what they told me they were doing and billed us for).  A few hours later they said they checked everything and said they could not find anything wrong and that all i really needed to do was use Lucas Fuel Injector Cleaner and to just add it to my gas tank before my fill up and it will fix the problem. Well after running through a full tank with Lucas Fuel Injector Cleaner, the car was still acting up, so i repeated this 4 times for the next month.  Nothing. the car just got worse.\n\nFirst thing i did was call up Dandy Auto, they did some work on our car when we first moved to this province 3 years ago so we thought, \"hey, everything they fixed on our car before still works fine\". i think the main reason we never went to Dandy Auto was because they are more expensive than Canadian Tire. \n\nWell there is a lesson we learned here. You get what you pay for!\n\nThe first thing we noticed was that the lady at reception who answered the phone had a much better idea of what could be wrong with my car than the mechanic at Canadian Tire. They got me to take my car in quickly and they dropped me home with the Free Shuttle Service they provided (Bonus points). They called me later that day and gave me a list of all the apparent problems that is wrong with my car, and boy was it a long list. i needed a new Clutch, Timing Belt, Spark Plugs/Wire, Axle Seals, Slave Cylinder, Gaskets, Water Pump, ETC most of which were all original parts. They also  found out that 2 of the 4 new DIRECTIONAL WINTER Tires that were purchased and installed by Canadian TIRE were put on BACKWARDS, so they corrected that. \n\nNot only did they fix the everything within 2 days, but they did a full detail of the car, looking like the first day we purchased the car. They made us feel like we were true valued customers. When we came to pick up the car the auto mechanic foreman as well as the 2 front desk girls, who may i add were also very knowledgeable and friendly, took the time to go through all the work which was done in detail and showing me the parts that were taken out and how those parts worked. they took the time to explain exactly what was fixed, why it needed to be fixed. it was apparent how passionate the people are at Dandy Auto are. I am happy to say that the car runs smooth like butter!\n\nBesides having a roof over your head, the second most important thing is your vehicle, It is worth putting out the extra money to have your car fixed by a true professional as the difference is having a your car not only last years longer but keeping you and your family safe. We will always get all our work done at Dandy Auto for now on!", "date": "2016-01-07 01:12:49"}

Today as we sat in the car I flipped through a newspaper and found out about Mio; and am I ever glad I did. This restaurant is a short drive away from Crossiron Mills and perfect for those that hate to look for parking.\n\nThe restaurant atmosphere was welcoming and was very cozy. Upon entering, I was hit by a food scent that I couldn't quite place... and still can't... perhaps it was the smell of cooked meat?\n\nAnywhos, aside from that, the menu was easy to navigate and the server was super helpful in explaining the menu. We opted to go for a Dinner on Rock, Grasshopper Roll, and various Sushi and a Maki Roll (Tamago, Ikura, Salmon and Spicy Salmon Roll) all to share.\n\nI felt that they took a fusion approach with their sushi, the tamago was a bit on the softer and wetter side as well. We were quite surprised with the Grasshopper roll; it was quite \"green\" to taste but very addicting!\n\nThe star of the supper was of course the \"Dinner on Rock\". This package included soup, salad, rice, dessert, dipping sauces and a variety of 8 oz total meats for our grilling pleasure (Beef, Lamb, Scallop, Prawn, Salmon). The process reminded me of going to Grizzly Paw in Banff, but at a much more affordable price. The process was very enjoyable as it was so hands on and much less intimidating than going to a Korean BBQ. The table ended up covered in butter and meat juices, so make sure you don't leave your phone near the stone grill.\n\nOverall we enjoyed our experience immensely, and left with our clothes filled with the aroma of cooked meat. Would highly recommend for those looking for something different close to the Calgary area.", "date": "2015-01-24 20:06:08"}

This is where you'll find it.\n\nIt's not cheap, but you pay for what you get and this is better than I've had back in BC.  We weren't sure about trying it but a few of the yelp Elite had posted good reviews, nevermind the history of reviews encouraging a positive experience, so we gave it a shot.\n\nD had a miso soup which I might try next time - it wasn't too salty even after adding a little soysauce and had just the right balance of green onion and creamy tofu.\n\nWe shared a prawn tempura, the batter light and crispy, well seasoned, wrapped around perfect fresh prawns.  On the side was a lemon wedge with some kind of powder on it (looked like wasabi powder but we're not entirely sure what it was) and some fluffy ginger.  We squeezed the lemon with weird powder into the tempura sauce and added some of the white fluffy ginger, and wow was that ever the best tempura sauce we've ever had!\n\nOn a whim I ordered my usual Chicken Karaage, which came out as lollypop style with a spicy mayo dip.  Normally you see those and think \"That is going to be dry or undercooked\" but you would be wrong - they were juicy, perfectly cooked, and light.  The batter around them was seasoned well enough you didn't need the dip, but you would use the dip anyway because it had flavour that just popped with the chicken.\n\nWe also tried one Ebi Special roll each which was super spicy and fresh, a Smoked Sake Nigiri each that was very fresh but had a very very light smoke flavour, and he tried the Unagi Nigiri which supposedly was better than Benkey in Aldergrove - hard to believe since even I would eat that one!\n\nI tried the Negitoro roll, very fresh and light, I've gotten used to the chunky green onion most places use so the light strands were a surprise.  We each got a Philadelphia roll because there's no sharing that one!  Chilled cream cheese with fresh salmon, avocado, and leftover spicy mayo to dip it in?  The best!\n\nThe last roll that we took our time on was the Salmon Isobe roll.  We weren't sure what to expect with this one so when it came out we didn't recognize it at first.  Spicy sauce on the plate with the rolls neatly laid out.  The rolls themselves were salmon wrapped in the seeweed and a super light tempura-like batter.  It was obvious that the rolls had been dipped in a frier just long enough to crisp the batter and sear the fish without loosing any of the freshness - that takes some serious skills!  To get that timing right, kudos to the cook!\n\nWe love this place and will be going back for sure!!

They were running a special on $49 out of province inspections. I made an appt over the phone and they fit me in really fast. They got our business for two reasons -\n1. They were very reasonably priced. . \n2. They were the only company I called that actually picked up their phone. \n( Cassandra goes above and beyond to make sure all calls are picked up, shes super woman)\n\nI got my truck in, it took about 4 hours but they were really through. I got a small list of things that needed to repaired to pass inspection and they gave me a reasonable quote. My husband however used this as an excuse to try out a different shop that is run by a family member.\n\nSo we came back to our re inspection. I was quoted 30-1 hour. About 15 minutes into it, I was pulled into the service bay to have a talk. The shop we had just taken our truck to botched our rear breaks and then tried to cover it up. Bryan the service technician carefully and in great detail showed me the damage. He explained what the other mechanic did and what he tried to do to 'fix' it. If you want to call it that. The break was a ticking time bomb and eventually I would have lost my breaks. I am so thankful to Bryan that he caught this and repaired it.\n\nSo we ordered all the parts and he went away to work. Unfortunately the caliper bracket didnt make it to us on time and I had to wait (at no fault to them) for 7 hours with a toddler. Cassandra did everything in her power to make sure I had supplies to entertain my daughter. Everyone was so nice and forgiving that my tiny terror was running around and occasionally screaming.\n\nAt the end of the day it became obvious that the part wasn't coming in time. Cassandra called around to get me a rental, but everyone was booked out. And do you know what? I was stranded. Bryan the tech DROVE US HOME. He totally went out of his way to help us, we didn't have very many options to get home.\n\nSo they got the part this morning and fixed up the truck. It cost us nearly double what Dandy quoted us when it was all said and done. In hindsight we should of just let them do it. I'm so thankful for Cassandra, Bryan and the entire Dandy crew. Bryan will be the only person working on our truck from here on out.", "date": "2016-08-17 06:59:04"}

It was $30 so we expected amazing Vera's quality type burgers.\n\nThe quality did not meet the price we paid...\n\nFor the burger itself:\n-The burgers were only slightly larger than a standard little cheeseburger at McDonalds\n-the patties tasted exactly like McDonalds cheeseburger patties\n-the cheese was halfway between Cheezewiz and Kraft Singles consistency and flavour\n-my so-called 'grilled onions' were white and raw, lukewarm at best\n-neither of us could taste the bbq or steak sauce at all\n-the burger itself looked like it had been sat on it was so squished\n\nFor the fries:\n-first of all $4.19 is a bloody large amount to pay for a medium fries\n-if you are going to serve fries in more than one size please use containers that fit the requested quantity (there was so much\noverflow from the little cups they give you that we had to dig through the excess to find our burgers in the takeout bag they give you even when you're eating there).  They should have given us either 4 cups full of fries or bigger cups.  or forwarned us how big the portion was and we could have split - we did make it clear that we had never eaten there before when we asked about the burger sizes.\n\nOtherwise the fries were decent if slightly overcooked.\n\nAll in all we left feeling like we could have had better value for our money at any cheap fastfood joint, and we really wish that someone would open a Vera's out here...now those are good burgers worth $15/head.", "date": "2015-03-11 18:43:07"}

It was pretty disappointing, considering how Airdrie Wok has a great buffet and is really clean. \n\nAs we got to the restaurant, we walked through the front glass door, and went through the right-hand door ... into the lounge. We backed  out, and went through the left-hand side into the narrow entrance of the restaurant. \n\nWe were greeted, and told to take a seat wherever we liked. The restaurant was empty at 6pm on a Friday night except us, and one other family - others straggled in as our meal went on, but it remained very quiet. \n\nWe took our seats, and were given some water. We  then sat for about 5 minutes before anyone asked us if we would like the buffet or menus - we decided we'd give the buffet a try. \n\nFairly typical Chinese buffet was offered, including the usual wonton soup, rice, noodles, sauced and deep-fried fare. The deep-fried foods were all over-doughy and a bit oily, as though the deep-frier wasn't hot or clean enough. The pork fat on the dry ribs was incredibly strong, and the veggies were over-cooked to the point of being mushy. Most of the food could easily have been sitting on the buffet since the lunch buffet was put out, judging by it's freshness. The highlights, however, were the simple wonton soup and the chicken skewers that seemed to be curried - the rest I could have quite easily left on my plate. Dessert options were  minimal - the traditional yellow cookies served on buffets, and a bucket of strawberry ice cream was left  in the buffet freezer... I passed on dessert. \n\n\nDespite the less-than-stellar meal, the staff was polite and quick with clearing plates and refilling water glasses. The prices  were affordable ($9.99 lunch buffet and $12.99 dinner buffet), and we got fortune cookies to go. My fortune: \"One  good turn deserves another..\" Consider this review a \"good turn\" - unless you're starving and unable to get to the next closest restaurant, I'd pass on this experience. Check out Airdrie Wok or Jen's Vietnamese on Main Street (West Airdrie) for some much more appealing Asian-inspired fare.", "date": "2014-08-30 01:12:57"}

The place was a little bit too lit up for me in an orangey tone for evening and we were seated right smack dab in front of the kitchen area. We got to hear several of the cooks' favorite songs sung by... themselves! Menu was too large and overwhelming, breakfast, lunch AND dinner served here. I guess that was another clue that it would not be the best choice for intimate dining. We played it safe by ordering some snacks and got out as fast as we could to go somewhere else for cocktails. I had NO desire to order a drink from here. Not our original plan but you roll with it and we will not return.

The server brings a hot rock slab to your table with 8 oz of various meats such as lamb, beef, prawn, scallop and salmon.  You smear butter on the stone which is sizzling hot and then place your cut up meats on the slab and wait 3 or 4 minutes for them to cook.  The stone dinner included miso soup and a tasty salad.  There were 3 dipping sauces included with the entree which were good to very good.  They included a spicy mayo, steak sauce and teriyaki sauce.  I felt the steak sauce could have been a bit better, but it was decent.  \n\nWe had some salmon sushi that was very creamy in texture and excellent and sesame ice cream that my wife liked a lot and she thought was an excellent alternative to the usual dessert options.  \n\nThe atmosphere is very nice and service was great.

I felt like I had an amateur and was almost humoured by the lack of professionalism and finesse I was experiencing. \n\nOnce my session was done, my toes got smudged as she put my flip flops on (which isn't her fault - it happens), however she wiped part of the over thick polish off but not all of it, which obviously made for a horrible base to begin again. She literally globed on some more polish on top and then left with a sharp and quick \"You're done.\" and whoosh she disappeared. I actually laughed I was so stunned. \n\nI promptly went home, had to remove the polish since it wasn't hardening and there was no way I could wear shoes it was such a mess. I also redid my fingernails because once I looked closer, I realized the top coat was also so thick it had bubbled. So disappointing.\n\nGreat set up in an old converted home so has great potential. Not quality work when it came to the nail salon side of things. Perhaps the rest of the spa has higher caliber staff. No complaints on the other staff I saw walking around, they all seemed very nice and attentive. \n\nI don't typically write reviews, but I am for sure disappointed.

The restaurant was maybe 75% full and yet we had to wait 20 minutes for table.  Next the food took another 40-45 minutes to arrive after ordering.  It seemed like an eternity for food to arrive and people that ordered way after us had their food either before us or soon after us.  It was a little ridiculous to be honest.  Some of the potatoes and toast were burnt.  The bacon strips were thin, overcooked and felt apart.   Then an item that we forgot about that didn't come was on the bill.

A rash of bad service or uninspired food pretty much ruins a guy's day, ya know? Thankfully, Ricky's was  a pleasant surprise, enough that we went back again this week. \n\nRicky's is a western Canadian restaurant chain, so I've been to other before, with varying degrees of happiness, and Airdrie's seems to be a good one. We've tried a few breakfast items over a two occasions, and so far, so good. My top choice on the menu is the Waffle Big Breakfast, where you get half of a waffle, 3 strips of bacon, 3 sausage links, 3 eggs, and the \"Stuffed Hashbrowns\". Stuffed Hashbrowns are basically the thing I would keep going back for - simply shredded hashrbrowns that have cheese, green onion, and sour cream mixed in to make a rich, delicious, calorie-filled treat. We've also tried the eggs benedict and the breakfast bowls, and both have  been great - the Blackstone Bowl is definitely worth trying if you're trying to decide on what to order. \n\nThe atmosphere at the Airdrie location is great - more of a restaurant and lounge feel than the typical breakfast  place, with staggered high-walled booths so you're not tripping over other people's morning conversations. The staff is very attentive and friendly, and the coffee doesn't really get a chance to run dry, which is exactly what I need in the morning. Meals haven't taken long to get, either, and it's comfortable enough that you don't mind sitting around for one last cup of coffee before you take off after getting the bill. \n\nIf I had to point out one flaw, it was that the waffles I've had on both occasions weren't' served as hot as I'd like them to be - the whipped butter  on top stayed pretty firm without melting ... I could have sent it back, but honestly, the rest of the dish was more than enough food, so I wasn't overly worried if my waffle was a bit cold. Everything else about the plate was great though - hot eggs, crispy bacon, and melty cheese in the hashbrowns.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with Ricky's, and I think this will be my new go-to for Airdrie breakfasts.", "date": "2015-08-05 23:25:29"}

A daily special offers approximately $2 off regular prices and, as with many Vietnamese restaurants, the portion sizes were nothing to sneeze at.\n\nMy table ordered a number of diverse items, from salad rolls to wor-wonton soup, to the quintessential fried egg and grilled pork chops on vermicelli. Having had the opportunity to sample a little of everything my family ordered, I found it all delicious. Expertly and timely cooked and delivered, the pork chops were succulent and beautifully-seasoned; the soup rich, with a tasty broth that was neither too salty nor not salty enough. And any Vietnamese meal is, in my mind, somewhat incomplete without a steaming cup of Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk - which was perfect.\n\nThe decor was homey and oddly-mixed, featuring Asian-inspired art alongside taxidermy animal heads - I assumed an homage to the Alberta landscape. Multiple fish tanks lined the back walls hosting an array creatures large and small. The service was friendly and prompt.\n\nI was surprised when I checked in that no one had ever reviewed Petite Saigon before and I'm happy to provide it's first glowing review.

The signs let you know which items the cooks can dress your burgers with. And they're also up-front with their vegetarian options, which include;\n\na) A veggie sandwich\nb) A veggie sandwich with cheese\nc) A grilled cheese sandwich.\n\nAnd I still have no idea what the difference is between a veggie sandwich with cheese and the grilled cheese sandwich.  Both apparently customizable with the same fixins as the meaty burgers. Five Guys doesn't offer a veggie patty. Sarah went with the grilled cheese sandwich, which is grilled on an inverted hamburger bun, with mayo slathered on the outsides in lieu of butter.\n\nFries are fresh, and made from real potatoes. They are delicious, but I wish you could order them in a smaller size.\n\nAnd let's get to the actual burger. The patties are fairly thin - I recommend the double if you want to feel as if you're eating something of substance. The patties are apparently hand formed, but like all Canadian burgers, are well done and not especially juicy, but still provided that general burger eating thrill.\n\nMy one issue with the burger was that the processed cheese wasn't entirely melted. At my beloved In-N-Out, I can always rely on having melted cheese.\n\nI will gladly return to Five Guys, but will never go out of the way to eat at one.

In fairness, I always have done take out from this location.  The unfortunate nature of the open window is hearing the trash talk in the kitchen.

I wish it had only been on one pick up order that I wanted him to \"ear muff it\". \n\nI also didn't realize that Swiss Chalet no longer did rotisserie chicken, and had decided to now do rotisserie sparrows.  I can get a way better value to buy a rotisserie chicken at any local grocery store, and either stop in to buy sauce, or buy the Swiss Chalet packaged sauce at Safeway.  We got used to doing \"fakey Chalet\" when there was no Swiss Chalet to go to.  And now?  I have realized that doing fakey Chalet tastes just as good, and is a WAY better value than the real thing now.\n\nI hate to sound like an ancient person who says \"Back when I was a kid\", but even back when I was in my mid-late 20's, Swiss Chalet offered value for your dollar.

The spring rolls were very good, the Pho was tasty, and M reported the grilled pork vermicelli bowl on par with her favourites.\n\nAppy, adult drinks, and dinners, for two adults + one small eater at $40 felt very reasonable, and a very friendly conversation as we paid the bill, we will be back.\n\nOverall one of the better dining experiences to in Airdrie.

The fettucine alfredo i ordered to pick up was the serving size for a 5 yr old... it barely fill 1/4 of your take out container. Also the herbs sprinkled on top had some fresh but some were either old and crusty or straight up soggy and rancid. No shallots or basil either as your menu states. This \"dish\" was something you could buy $1 dried noodles and a $2 jar of cream sauce at the store and it would taste better. You offered me a refund but now i have to drive back up there, and find something else to eat for dinner,which honestly ill probably take my $10 to noodle box for 3x the food thats 10x the taste and ingredients. I wont be back and wont reccomend. \nUpdate: after a very confrontational and combative approach from the owner as i came in to return i know i ABSOLUTELY will not return! I entered and i told the hostess that i was here because i called and was offered a refund. The owner gerard came out and was instantly defensive. No \"i apologize you were not satisfied\" or anything. Just ready to fight basically. you didnt even introduce your self, i had to ask the hostess after who you were. He was very rude and told me all my complaints are my issue and that the missing basil and shallots are pureed into the sauce LOL (ya thats why its bright white right) and thats hes served 40 today with no issues. He also said that the very small portion is because of their $10 pasta wednesday. If your going to run a deal dont be sneaky about serving sizes from your regular menu because thats not advertised anywhere. Its not a deal if you get half  the food for $6 less.  I really cant believe as the owner you have no pride in your business to try and make a customer feel appreciated instead of basically calling them an idiot. WTF", "date": "2018-08-09 02:21:22"}

We perused the menu and decided on our orders. I thought it was neat that I could order chicken or beef salad rolls! That's different. I had the beef salad rolls and a bowl with meat (I think beef, that's what I normally get) and spring rolls. It was DELICIOUS. All the food was very fresh,and flavorful. \n\nI now go there regularly (At least once a week, sometimes twice), but I go for the soup. Their soup is AMAZING. My friend got me hooked on it.

Standard mix of rice and (shocker) noodle dishes with a choice of proteins. Prices range from 10-15$ for a respectably large bowl. Definitely a full meal. You select the spice level. Note! The spice levels are not your standard food court/shopping mall heat. Med/Hot gave me neck sweat and Hot made the Asian guy down the table break into full body sweats and head back for 4 glasses of water much to the amusement of his dining partner. The available 'Scorching Hot' level is best reserved for dares and hazing rituals. Food is prepared promptly in an open kitchen and service was fast. Dining music track was an loudly eclectic mix of 80's pop. Probably not a romantic date spot but if you were planning a first date night at a fast food noodle spot you have more game than me. Very good Tom Yum Soup and Thai Green Curry with fresh tasting ingredients. Defiantly will be back...\nExtras:\n-Both water and sparkling water complimentary from self serve dispensers\n-Customizable Kid sized noodle meal available so your little one won't burst on a full size bowl\n-Delivery available for a 4$ charge + 1$ debit/credit fee if you need noodles to come to you instead\n-BEER!

Although there's a Sophie's Pizza in Calgary, the Airdrie location worked out better as I was already in the area for another appointment.\n\nI called beforehand to order so that I would be able to pick up the pizzas right after my appointment. Unfortunately, they had a system issue and had lost my order. The woman who spoke to me was very apologetic and even offered an additional 15% off. I really appreciated that they owned up to their mistake and put an effort in making it up to me. Luckily, I only had to wait 15 mins or so.\n\nI can totally see why my coworkers love this place. To describe it, it's like a better version of Chicago deep dish pizza. It's toppings were of good quality and everything was put together nicely. The crust was thick albeit still tasty. And although this pizza definitely wasn't a healthy choice, it wasn't drenched in a pool of grease/oil like most fast food pizza joints are usually known for. We ordered the Royale and the Beefed Up. Both were delicious, but I preferred the Beefed Up over the Royale.\n\nSophie's Pizza lands itself as a \"premium\" fast food pizza choice with its expensive price tag, but it's good to know that if you order a medium or large pizza, you can get the second one for 50% off. I'll definitely return, but it'll have to be spaced out.", "date": "2015-11-06 18:05:51"}

It was my first foray into independence because I was allowed to walk down the alley and through the neighbor's yard to get there on my own, and I have a ton of great memories of watching all sorts of shows there in the 90s. They've upgraded it since, and I still go at times, so this is where I get my perspective when I talk about The Roxy. \n\nThe Roxy is Airdrie's little hometown cinema. Boasting a whole two screens, this Landmark theatre typically runs at least one family-friendly show. The prices are great, considering the next closest option at CrossIron Mills is likely to run you over $40 for two movies and snacks, this can make for a cheap date night, a good way to get out of the house, or a fun and affordable family movie night. \n\nDon't expect a ton of extras here - you get your typical movie snacks (which, as usual, are a bit overpriced), a simple projection screen, and a decent sound system. I've watched some pretty good action movies here, and I wasn't disappointed at all - the sound was big enough for the room, clear, and not distorted. The pictures were clear and everything was sync'd up well, which is more than I can say for some much more expensive movies  I've seen at other places. \n\nThe Roxy also still has a cheap night, which is Tuesdays, so it can get busier. It's never as crazy as the Calgary theatres, so I'm not afraid  to stop by even then. In addition, if you choose to get on the email list, you'll be treated to loads of offers, from reduced snack prices  and early showing to BOGOs and discounts on tickets. If you're a movie buff, it's worth the once-a-week email.\n\nFinal verdict? If you live nearby, just try it out on a movie you're on the fence about - you won't lose a lot of money to see it, and you'll get to see how the theatre is the perfect addition to the smaller town. I'm sure you'll be back.", "date": "2015-09-11 04:32:36"}

I had not been their in a while and was in the area last night for a little mid week dinner out. \n\nLet's start off with the good things: \n- The restaurant seemed really clean. The tables were nicely wiped down with no weird film on them (as some tables at pubs tend to get). Every tables was neatly set up and waiting for guests. \n- The uniforms on the waitress were not too revealing and the seemed to be allowed to wear comfortable shoes. I know this is not a big deal for some people but it is for me. I don't like how some pubs have their waitress showing WAAYYY too much skin on top or on the bottom. I can't you how many times a hard working waitress has been just performing the regular functions on her job and I have seen a pantie or some boobage pop out of their 'uniform' (or lack there of), none of which is appropriate in a workplace. I also hate those restaurants that have their waitresses dress in super high heels while running their feet off and standing for long hours. I know those waitresses would never complain but as a patron I can tell your are in pain and I hate seeing it (jumping down from my soap box now).\n- They have a decent sized menu. There seems to be something for everyone so I could see how the place would be really inclusive to all food tastes. \n\nSome of the not so good things:\n- I found the food to be sorta pricey. Every plate was at least $14 for items that are less expensive at other pubs. My husband partook in the evening special which was a vegetarian pizza which was half off (that was a good deal) but the menu said it would be an 8 inch pizza and when it arrive it was 6 inches at best. I suppose maybe they 'measure' the pizza before it goes in the oven and then it's 8 inches or because it's on special it's smaller but if you were paying the full price, that pizza would be expensive for what you got. Don't get me wrong it was a tasty pizza but not worth the full price tag only worth the half off. \n-The food was just okay for the higher price tag. I had the Yorkies and I am a HUGE fan of Yorkshire pudding and these were good (my momma still makes the best thought.... SHOUT OUT TO MA!) but the roast beef was a little dry and the gravy was pretty salty and unidentifiably lumpy.  However, I just scraped that gravy off and enjoyed my plate of food, it just seemed expensive for what I got though. \n- I found the drink specials to be not that special, the Tuesday night beer special was really only $1.00 off the smallest one, $0.75 off the medium one and $0.25 off the largest one. I get it you are discounting beer and you don't want to be throwing profits away but come on, offer a better incentive and maybe it would be fuller in the restaurant. \n- The service was kinda slow to begin with. I hesitate to mention this as our waitress admitted that she was new (but in later conversation with her she said that she was there a month which is new-ish and makes me feel slightly better about mentioning this). We waited almost 20 minutes to get our menus. Not so much as a 'Hi, I'll be right with you' or an apology for the wait. She spent a lot of time chatting up the tables of men that were also assigned to her section. The place was also not really that busy so I wonder how service would be should it have been busier.\n\nLASTLY, the down right unacceptable:\n- They charge for refills on pop. WHAT?!?!?! Is it 1991? Have we stepped back into the past? Can we smoke now in this bar? Is Brian Mulroney Prime Minister? Is Ralph Klein the premier? I am sure that the menu mentions it, but, because its not 1991, I didn't even look to see if the pop was bottomless. So imagine my shock, when I received my bill and was not only charged $3.25 for a pop (which we all know cost less than a $0.25 and it was half ice) but I was charged an extra $1.00 for each refill. I was charged almost as much as a beer! If I would have had a beer, I probably would have received more actual liquid (on account of the pop being mostly ice).

I hope they hurry and build a location in Calgary since according to their website they do not have one here yet.\n\nFollowing a recent dinner with the kids in Airdrie we noticed this little place called Menchie's and something to do with frozen yogurt.  Since they behaved during dinner I decided a treat was in order.  We stopped in and it was bustling.  The friendly staff immediately explained how it works and we were hooked.  Before you decide on your flavours you are welcome to try as many samples as you wish.  All self serve. \n\nThe process goes as follows: take your bowl, pick a yogurt flavour, stick with that flavour or blend it with another.  Next choose toppings from the large selection, sauces, the works.  Make it as big or little as you want.  You pay by weight.  For 3 of us our treats came to $9 - Fantastico!!\n\nLiked their yogurt selection and later when I looked online I noticed they must have over 100 yogurt flavour combinations.  Here's hoping they offer these new flavours on a regular basis.  \n\nI further enjoyed reading on their website they are certified Kosher, gluten-free, vegan, and have no high fructose corn syrup options in their products.  They gave us a customer reward card and while my immediate reaction was oh great another card to pack around I decided it would be a good thing to have because I'm certain we will be back.", "date": "2013-02-06 16:08:45"}

He suggested we try this little pub, if it still existed, that he used to frequent back when he lived in Calgary 8 years ago.  So off we drove, got lost, and ended up finding the place in a little corner of Airdrie right where it used to be.\n\nFirst impressions - I probably wouldn't have thought to go in if he hadn't been with me.  There were people standing outside smoking and the windows were coated in something that gave them a mirror effect so you couldn't see inside to see what the place looks like.  His memory of the food was enough to encourage giving it a try anyway and I'm rather glad we did.\n\nOn the inside it's sort-of golf themed, and looks like your typical darkened pub.  We sat down at a table on the end of a column of 3 joined tables, in the quietest corner there.  Right away our server Shelley came by and gave us menus and took a drink order.  He had 2 Heineken bottles over the course of the meal and I had a Strongbow which thankfully came out of a bottle and not a can.  If it's not on tap I prefer the taste of bottled Strongbow, rather than the weak-flavoured metallic canned version.\n\nFor food D ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries and gravy.  The fries were crisp, the gravy rich and thick, and the sandwich I didn't steal a bite of but it was supposedly quite good.  I might try their pulled pork pizza next time.\n\nOn the other hand I tried one of their supposedly famous pizza's: the Cheeseburger.  It's one of their top selling pizzas and I can see why.\n\nCrust: the perfect halfway point between thin-crust and pan-style so it was crispy but not overly crunch and had great flavour.\nToppings: there was lots of everything on top, with a great undertone of taco seasoning which worked great!  Lots of ground beef, sauce, cheese, enough that half a pizza was filling even as a 10\"!\nLeftovers:  Your typical fast-food pizza tastes like cardboard the next day.  Not so with this.  I saved 2 large pieces for lunch the next day and honestly it was almost as good as it was fresh out of the oven.  I probably could have left it in the toaster oven a few more minutes but even then it was delicious on the second day.\n\nThe only sad thing is their appetizers seem to be rather expensive for what you get.  I'd have to see a serving size of the deep fried dill pickles before I order one because 4 pcs does not sound like a lot for the cost they're charging.\n\nI would definitely order that pizza again and i will be going back to Bogey's.", "date": "2015-03-30 22:07:44"}

Wasted $18. \nLasagna: husband said it tasted like it was one of the frozen kinds you buy at Safeway but ate it anyway. Not worth the $22. \nPortions were tiny for the exorbitant prices. If you're going to charge that much for food, you better make sure it's good! \nI totally regret not canceling my order.\nUpdate. We received a full refund. Thanks.", "date": "2018-07-16 08:34:56"}

How could you see a cake like that and not slobber all over the artist who made it??\n\nI am completely over-the-moon thrilled with the cake/art I purchased and I can't recommend the bakery enough to anyone who wants a cool custom cake or just some delicious treats -- they do everything!", "date": "2015-10-22 17:28:32"}

One of the ones that came up was this place.  D and I agreed it was definitely a sushi night, and since he trusted her opinion on food we thought we'd give it a try.\n\nIt was a quiet night there, which was good for us, only a couple of tables were filled, and honestly the first thing I noticed was the crazy colours of the labradorite flecks in the table surface.  The tabletops are beautiful!  At the right angle there were crazy hits of blue, green and gold that were unmistakably labradorite.  Beautiful.\n\nAnyway we shared a pot of tea, which was delicious and very hot.  D had a miso soup and 2 pcs of Unagi to start.  I tried a sip of the soup and it was very fresh, nice flavour, not overly salty like some miso soups, and looked like it had just the right amount of tofu.  I didn't try the unagi, it's good but doesn't always sit well with me afterwards (I've been afraid to have it since an incident in Vancouver - long story involving a long drive).\n\nMy starter was a plate of beef tataki.  I haven't had that in a long time, since it's normally quite expensive, but the portion size more than made up for it here and it was delicious.  The beef had had just a touch of heat around the outside so it was deliciously rare throughout, the spicy sauce was amazing, and I had to restrain myself from licking the plate.\n\nWe shared a Crispy California Roll that was almost as good as our favourite place in Vancouver so I'll be ordering those every time for sure - it's all in the unagi sauce they drizzle on top.  It seriously makes all the difference in the flavour!  It was so good I ordered a second one at the end.\n\nThe other dish we shared was a Delicate Roll which is a really nice variation on a Philadelphia Roll but with a few additions.  It was fresh, the salmon was delicious, and the avocado was just right.  I'm not sure about the mayo drizzle on top but I didn't mind it.\n\nNext time I plan on trying the tempura, and honestly I think the only thing they're missing is a Las Vegas Roll...I'd eat there every week if they had that too!\n\nOur server was great, very chatty and totally familiar with the sushi we're used to since she was from the same area.\n\nAll in all it was a pleasant experience in a clean, friendly setting and we left stuffed.  I can't wait to go back for more.", "date": "2015-11-24 04:25:01"}

It looks longer a great place to hit up.\n\nReality: \n\n1) Carts for Rent. The store still has a \"cart rental\" system, so be sure to bring a quarter with you to release your dirty cart from the stalls. Don't forget to return it  or you'll be out a buck later.\n\n2) Lack of products. The store is frequently out of advertised sale items. Not just out of product on the shelves, but store-wide. There are lots of signs all over advertising supply shortage and \"substitutions\", but don't count on getting exactly what you went there for. Even as early as Sunday morning, you'll be likely to see holes in the shelves. Oh, and no rainchecks.\n\n3) PC Points is a joke. Every other chain's loyalty program lets you buy what you need and get rewarded. Some offer bonuses on certain products. No Frills makes you load digital offers on specific products, and you'll only get points if you buy those items. Spent $50 on groceries? No points unless you bought those products. Bought those items but forgot to load the offers from the app or website? No points there either. \n\n4) BYOB - bring your own bag or you'll be paying for each one you need. If you're bad at guessing, you'll end up short and need to buy more, or end up with extras. And don't expect help bagging...that's on you, friend. \n\n5) No customer service desk. Want to inquire about something? You'll have to hunt for someone in the store, or wait in the register line. If you're lucky, you'll get an associate who can help. Most of the staff is pretty friendly, even if they can't help you, so there is that.\n\nThis store is good if you need something cheap and generic, but for the poor quality of the service and lack of product, I'd recommend Co-op instead, 9 times out of 10.", "date": "2015-02-08 21:35:04"}

She mentioned Avenue Bakery and my eyeballs almost popped out of my eye sockets because that's exactly what was on my mind and has been on my mind for quite some time.  Six of us crammed into one car, google mapped the bakery and headed on over.  \n\nApparently if you follow google maps, it doesn't take you exactly where the bakery is.  We got a little confused with the area it was in but eventually sniffed our way to Avenue. Pulling up, I was shocked as the parking lot was empty but there was a lady coming out with a cake.  I was debating whether I should jump her or just go into the bakery myself.  I'm thankful I made the right decision to go into the bakery because I was amazed by how much goodies were on display.  Places like Avenue get me sooOoOoOOO excited I can hardly contain myself - I love love little bake shoppes for all the sweet homemade goodness and wish they had more places like this in Calgary.\n\nI think I admired the display for about 20 minutes. To the left there is a display of loaves, cinnamon buns, pies, cookies ETC.  and the main display had all the cupcakes, STUFFED cupcakes, cheesecakes, squares, cake balls ETC.  I knew I wanted to try the stuffed cupcakes because coworkers and friends have been really raving about them. I was going to order 5, 4 to go and eat one right there but there was some deal, I think buy 6 get one free - something of that sort. Anyway, I declined and just went with four, only because I knew I would eat them all..in one sitting.  I ordered a chocolate cheesecake cup, stuffed oreo cupcake, german chocolate cake, and rolo cupcake.  I also got a salty caramel bar so I could save the cupcakes til I got home to share. I actually wanted to buy everything on display but I know that would be bad bad news. Everyone else got some stuffed cupcakes as well.\n\nThe salty caramel bar was like a chocolate brownie with some salted caramel and some condensed milk glaze, it was ok - it was put in a little bag and it got all sticky, I should have eaten it right away.  I really couldn't believe that I didn't touch any of the cupcakes till after I got home, it was really tough but I did it!  The cupcakes had been sitting at room temperature for some time before I got to them. First, I cut the oreo cupcake in half, YUM. The chocolate cake was super moist and the filling was a light oreo cream. The german chocolate cake was wonderful, I really love the filling, nice light coconut flavor with a little crunch from the nuts.  The chocolate cheesecake cup was heavenly.  A layer of chocolate cake, then cheesecake, dolloped with chocolate cream covered with chocolate, it felt super light and airy and tasted great.  My least favorite of the batch was the rolo. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed all of them but the icing on top of the rolo was rich and thick, it would have been great if it was as smooth as the oreo cream but the caramel filling was really good!\n\nWhen I get cupcakes, I like getting a mix of chocolate cake and vanilla cake but I found that there were only a few flavors with vanilla cake and I wasn't feelin' fruity.  My suggestion would be to make each flavor with the two different cakes, it could be a good thing!  Oh! And I found that letting the cupcakes sit at room temperature as opposed to straight from the fridge is much better and moist.  \n\nConfession time:  IMHO, these cupcakes are the best cupcakes, even better than Crave cupcakes =O okay okay I said it...Avenue bakery is AMAZEBALLS.  I would definitely say that Avenue Bakery is worth the drive if you're in Calgary.", "date": "2015-06-17 21:03:05"}

I have to confess that I've been to Airdrie many times to visit friends but have never frequented any of their restaurants. One thing is for sure, you won't leave hungry. Paros on Main is a Greek restaurant. The deco is simple with the usual blue and Grecian ware found all over Greece. We didn't have to wait for a table but I have to warn you not to go there hungry or else order appetizers right away. We had arrived from an open house that served nibbles and only ordered entrees but these took over half an hour to arrive.\nI found Paros by searching for nearby restaurants via the Yelp app on my phone. There were $$ attached to the restaurant but really when you look at the portions this is a place for cheap eats. I had the kleftiko ($25) and my companion the grilled chicken ($21). The chicken entr\u00e9e consisted of 2 HUGE chicken breasts, salad and potatoes. The lamb was 2 slices with salad and potatoes. You have a choice of Greek or Caesar Salad and either rice or potatoes. We both took home leftovers for a separate meal.\nThe chicken was tender and moist and delicious according to my companion. The kleftiko I had was average. It lacked flavour. The potatoes were cooked through and well-seasoned with salt and lemon juice. The Greek salad was also average. I couldn't detect any oregano but it had a good proportion of kalamata olives and feta. \nA favourite of regulars is the saganiki or flaming cheese. We didn't try it but it was certainly very popular with the other patrons. The servers at Paros certainly know how to present it with a flourish, they yell \"Opa!\" as they ignite the brandy and it's a good show of flames. The food is ok but not worth a drive to Airdrie for Greek food but certainly if you are in the area and craving Greek it would be a good place to stop.\nMy companion made use of the facilities and reported that the ladies washroom was spotless. Our server was friendly and kept our drinks topped up. There is a great server to patron ratio, it looked as if there was a server per every two tables. Paros on Main is as its name suggests, right on Main Street, so there is street parking and we didn't have any problems finding a spot. The only caveat to the street parking is that it is only 1 hour parking till 9 p.m. at certain spots. I'm not sure how strictly enforced this is.", "date": "2014-11-07 19:23:33"}

Taylor was fantastic. It was tedious work, and some of the locations were high and awkward. But he took it all in stride and kept smiling through the entire 10 hours. Very, very nice young man.

Shame on Vesta properties for selling us homes and then treating us like this. Our main contact at Astoria is Kara Bocking and she is rude when we contact the office for information on the condo regulations. To add to this they have hired a security firm to patrol the parking lot on a nightly basis to hand out parking tickets to home owners who are parked in unused 'visitor' stalls because each household is only assigned 1 stall. So if you have 2 cars (a minimum standard in this day and age) you are expected to fight over the 'common stalls' with everyone else in the neighborhood. Parking here in Williamstown is a nightmare.

After Kisamos in Steveston and Five Columns in Bellingham our expectations were high.  One night, we stopped outside Paros on Main to try them out as our first greek in Alberta.\n\nWhile decent, unfortunately I think our search will continue.  The meal itself was okay, but there were elements that were not up to our expectations for the price we paid.\n\nFirstly, we were forewarned when we arrived that they were out of their supposedly 'famous' potatoes.  If they are in such high demand and the restaurant has been around long enough, why are they unable to make sufficient quantities for their expected patronage?\n\nSecondly, every single greek restaurant we have ever been to, even the terrible ones, start with some fresh fluffy warm pita bread even without appetizers, but not at Paros on Main.\n\nWe ordered a Kleftiko dinner each and at every other restaurant we've been to they are large juicy fall-off-the-bone roasts with beautiful flavours and are usually a good sized shank, which comes with salad, rice, potatoes, and tzatziki.\n\nWhat we got for meat was more like roast beef - a dry steak of lamb meat which was tough to chew and sadly a waste of the delicious crust on the outside.  I ordered the caesar salad and rice (as there were no potatoes and you actually had to choose between rice or potato???).  The caesar came with dressing, cheese and a lemon wedge but no croutons or bacon bits so it tasted plain.  The lettuce was fresh but that only does so much.\n\nThe rice I had to send back because they put vegetables in it including mushrooms. I am allergic to mushrooms and since when does greek rice come with mushrooms?  I've only ever seen that at restaurants who don't know how to flavour their rice. D was able to eat his rice and said I was right in that it was dry and flavourless.\n\nFor the price we paid and the flavour/texture of the food, I'm surprised this restaurant is so popular and we will keep searching for something closer to the juicy, beautiful greek lamb we're used to and love.", "date": "2015-09-21 23:50:41"}
